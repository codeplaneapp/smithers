/**
 * One lane's seal, read back off the lane's own artifacts — for either arm.
 *
 *   node breach-scan.mjs --ledger f [--logs dir] [--journals dir] \
 *     [--label text] [--require none] [--out dir] [--json]
 *
 * `compare-codex-lanes.mjs` asserts the seal on the *codex* arm, as one column
 * of a two-lane comparison. This asks the same question of one lane on its own,
 * and of **either harness**, because from 2026-08-24 both arms run their
 * testbed on `--network none` and a claim made for one arm is worth nothing
 * unless the same evidence is produced for the other.
 *
 * Two assertions, and they are the two halves the `none` lane's report already
 * owes:
 *
 * - **every container was measured `none`.** The ledger carries what the lane
 *   *asked* for (`testbedNetwork`) and what `docker inspect` said the container
 *   was actually on at the instant it started (`testbedNetworkObserved`). The
 *   assertion reads the observation, never the request: a lane that judged
 *   itself by its request would be checking a variable against itself. A row
 *   with no observation at all fails the same way a `bridge` one does — an
 *   unmeasured container is not a sealed container.
 * - **zero successful egress, in every trace.** Under `none` this is redundant,
 *   which is the point: the breach column has to come out zero *by
 *   construction*, and a non-zero one means the constraint did not hold
 *   somewhere the ledger did not see.
 *
 * **An attempt is not an outcome, and under `none` the difference is the whole
 * report.** `breaches` in `compare-codex-lanes.mjs` deliberately does not read a
 * command's result — on a `bridge` lane a `docker exec … curl` is assumed to
 * have worked, because it would have. Under `--network none` it cannot: the
 * container has `lo` and nothing else, which is the fact `./network-dryrun.sh`
 * establishes against a real daemon. Counting those attempts as breaches failed
 * the first sealed lane that ran on 2026-08-25 — 6 of them, every one of which
 * the transcript showed dying on `Could not resolve host`.
 *
 * So for a container **observed** `none`, each in-container fetch is read to its
 * outcome, and the reading fails closed: the trace has to show the refusal,
 * either against that command or against another fetch in the same container.
 * An attempt in a container that is never shown refusing anything stays a
 * breach, because a fetch that left no evidence of failing inside a container
 * that cannot reach the network is a contradiction, and the scan reports
 * contradictions rather than resolving them in the lane's favour. For any other
 * container the old rule stands unchanged, so no `bridge` lane's report moves.
 *
 * None of that logic lives here. `egress`, `inContainerEgress`,
 * `provedUnnetworked` and `countedBreaches` are imported from
 * `compare-codex-lanes.mjs`, beside the patterns they extend, so the one-lane
 * scan and the two-lane comparison cannot reach different verdicts about the
 * same trace.
 *
 * **Where the trace lives differs per arm, and only that differs.** A codex run
 * writes one transcript, `logs/<id>.run.log`. A flows run writes a driver log of
 * the same name plus a journal, `journals/<id>/engine.db`, whose
 * `flows_journal_events.payload_json` holds every call the agent made and every
 * result it got back. Only agent evidence is handed to the same patterns; a
 * flows driver log is diagnostic and cannot substitute for its journal.
 *
 * It reads a ledger, some logs and some journals. No evaluator report, no
 * clock, no network. Running it twice over the same files produces the same
 * bytes.
