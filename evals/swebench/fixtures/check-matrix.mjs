/**
 * Replays the matrix driver's scheduler over a stub harness command.
 *
 * `run-matrix.sh` is the piece of the best-of-n rig that cannot be checked by
 * reading it: whether the schedule it produces really holds two invariants at
 * once — at most `jobs` runs in flight, and never two runs of the same instance
 * — is a statement about interleaving, and interleaving is what a stub can
 * exercise for nothing. `SWB_RUN_CMD` replaces the per-run command with a script
 * that records its own start and end, sleeps, writes a patch, and exits with a
 * chosen status.
 *
 * Every assertion is read off that ledger and the manifest the driver wrote:
 * the driver's own view (`matrix-<harness>.json`) has to agree with what the
 * runs actually did.
 *
 * Spends no tokens, needs no docker, needs no dataset, and runs no harness.
