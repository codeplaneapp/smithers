/**
 * Pins the one-screen status against the budgets the driver actually accepts.
 *
 *   node fixtures/check-fullbench-status.mjs
 *
 * `fullbench-status.sh` is read against a live benchmark, so a ledger it cannot
 * render is a benchmark an operator cannot look at. The figure most likely to
 * be typed by hand is the budget, and `fullbench.sh` accepts more spellings of
 * it than JSON does: `.50` passes its guard, and `lib/fullbench-row.mjs` only
 * numbers a value with a digit before the decimal point, so that budget reaches
 * `fullbench/manifest.jsonl` as the string `.50`.
 *
 * So this runs the real script over synthesised ledgers carrying a string
 * budget, no budget and a budget that is not a number, and asserts the screen
 * and the checkpoint report print the same figure for each. Spends nothing,
 * needs no docker and no dataset.
