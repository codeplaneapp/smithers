/**
 * Asserts `flows.sh` execs the CLI this repository ships.
 *
 *   node fixtures/check-cli-path.mjs
 *
 * The rig arrived from a checkout whose CLI was entered at
 * `packages/smithers/dist/esm/bin.js` directly. Here the shipped executable is
 * `packages/smithers/bin/smithers.mjs`, the file `@smthrs/cli` declares as its bin,
 * and it prefers that build but falls back to `src/bin.ts` when there is none.
 *
 * Both halves are checked, because each one alone is a trap:
 *
 *   - Exec the shim, and a wave run without a build silently measures source
 *     that no fingerprint covers. So the wrapper must refuse when the build is
 *     absent.
 *   - Exec the build directly, and the rig runs a file the product does not
 *     ship, which is how the path went stale in the first place.
 *
 * The refusal is checked by running the wrapper against a copy of the rig
 * rooted at a tree with no `dist`, so nothing has to be deleted from the real
 * checkout to prove it.
 *
 * Offline, spends nothing, needs no docker.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
