// Repository invariants a type cannot state. Shared by every package's
// `eslint.config.js` the same way `eslint.jsdoc.js` is.
//
// Each invariant closes one defect class that a review found repeated across
// packages and fixed by hand. A rule id on its own teaches nothing at 2am, so
// every message says what the shape does wrong, what the house writes instead,
// and where a correct example lives.
//
// Wiring, at the end of a package's config, after `...jsdocConvention`:
//
//   import { ambientAuthority, invariants, swallowedCause, uninstalledSafety } from "../../eslint.invariants.js"
//   ...
//   ...invariants(uninstalledSafety, swallowedCause, ambientAuthority)
//
// `invariants` is a function rather than a spreadable array because all three
// invariants are expressed with `no-restricted-syntax`, and flat config does
// not merge one rule's options across config objects: the last object matching
// a file replaces the options of every earlier one. Three fragments spread
// side by side would leave only the last one live, and the other two would sit
// in the tree looking enforced. `invariants` merges the selectors into one
// object so that cannot happen, and a package holding only some of them names
// exactly the ones it holds, which makes the gap visible in the config.
//
// Scope is `src/**` throughout. Tests are deliberately outside: `test/**` is
// not matched at all, and `src/test/**` (the in-package doubles under
// `packages/smithers/control/src/test`, `packages/smithers/flows/kernel/src/test`, and eight more) is
// ignored, because an uninstalled service and a discarded failure are what a
// double is for.
