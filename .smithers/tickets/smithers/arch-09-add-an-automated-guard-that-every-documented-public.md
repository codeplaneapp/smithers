# Add an automated guard that every documented public subpath export resolves

## Task

**Finding (file: `e2e/exports/programmatic-api.test.ts`):** There is no automated guard that every documented public subpath export actually resolves. Add a test that imports each documented public subpath of smithers-orchestrator and asserts it resolves to the expected symbols.

## Rules (non-negotiable — this repo's "No mocks" policy)

- Use **real backends/data**. Do NOT introduce `mockGateway`, `page.route`/`routeWebSocket` data fabrication, hand-rolled SQL schema, or hardcoded/fallback stand-ins. A test that mocks the thing it claims to exercise does not count.
- Follow the existing code/test style and conventions in the same package; put any test beside the sibling tests for that file.
- Keep root `pnpm typecheck` green and the touched package's `bun test` green (`pnpm -C <pkg> test`).
- Scope to THIS finding only — one focused change, one atomic emoji+conventional commit. Do not refactor unrelated code.
- If the task is genuinely too large to complete and keep the gate green in one focused change, do the largest safe, self-contained slice that is fully green and commit only that — never commit half-broken or stubbed work.

## Done when

- [ ] A test enumerates documented public subpaths and asserts each resolves; it passes.
