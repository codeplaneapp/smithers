# Break the agents <-> observability published circular dependency

## Task

**Finding (file: `packages/agents/src/BaseCliAgent/BaseCliAgent.js:5-6 ; apps/observability/src/_traceEventNormalizers.js:1-2`):** A circular dependency between @smithers-orchestrator/agents and @smithers-orchestrator/observability ships to npm. Break the cycle (e.g. invert the dependency, extract the shared types, or move the normalizer) so neither package imports the other at publish time.

## Rules (non-negotiable — this repo's "No mocks" policy)

- Use **real backends/data**. Do NOT introduce `mockGateway`, `page.route`/`routeWebSocket` data fabrication, hand-rolled SQL schema, or hardcoded/fallback stand-ins. A test that mocks the thing it claims to exercise does not count.
- Follow the existing code/test style and conventions in the same package; put any test beside the sibling tests for that file.
- Keep root `pnpm typecheck` green and the touched package's `bun test` green (`pnpm -C <pkg> test`).
- Scope to THIS finding only — one focused change, one atomic emoji+conventional commit. Do not refactor unrelated code.
- If the task is genuinely too large to complete and keep the gate green in one focused change, do the largest safe, self-contained slice that is fully green and commit only that — never commit half-broken or stubbed work.

## Done when

- [ ] The published cycle between agents and observability is removed; dependency-boundary check + typecheck + both packages' tests pass.
