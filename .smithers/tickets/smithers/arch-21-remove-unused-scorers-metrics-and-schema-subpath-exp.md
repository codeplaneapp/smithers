# Remove unused scorers ./metrics and ./schema subpath exports

> Target repo: **smithers** (this repo)
> Source: GitHub issue [#300](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/issues/300)

## Task

**Finding (file: `packages/scorers/package.json:8-25 ; packages/scorers/src/index.d.ts`):** packages/scorers declares `./metrics` and `./schema` subpath exports that no consumer uses, and types map all subpaths to the barrel index.d.ts. Remove the unused subpaths (and fix any remaining subpath types).

## Rules (non-negotiable — this repo's "No mocks" policy)

- Use **real backends/data**. Do NOT introduce `mockGateway`, `page.route`/`routeWebSocket` data fabrication, hand-rolled SQL schema, or hardcoded/fallback stand-ins. A test that mocks the thing it claims to exercise does not count.
- Follow the existing code/test style and conventions in the same package; put any test beside the sibling tests for that file.
- Keep root `pnpm typecheck` green and the touched package's `bun test` green (`pnpm -C <pkg> test`).
- Scope to THIS finding only — one focused change, one atomic emoji+conventional commit. Do not refactor unrelated code.
- If the task is genuinely too large to complete and keep the gate green in one focused change, do the largest safe, self-contained slice that is fully green and commit only that — never commit half-broken or stubbed work.

## Done when

- [ ] Unused scorers subpaths are removed; no consumer breaks; typecheck + tests green.
