/**
 * The flow the crash family kills.
 *
 * One declared step whose implementation runs two sealed actions in order. The
 * first commits immediately; the second announces itself with a marker file,
 * starts a real detached process, and then sleeps long enough for the test to
 * reach in and `SIGKILL` the host while it is genuinely in flight.
 *
 * Every observable this makes is a file, because the only reader that survives
 * a `SIGKILL` is the filesystem. The execution counter is append-only and
 * cross-process: one line per dispatch, so a replayed sealed result adds
 * nothing and a re-executed action adds a line. That is the whole exactly-once
 * assertion, written where a killed process cannot rewrite it.
