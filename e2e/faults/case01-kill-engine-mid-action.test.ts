/**
 * Case 1 — the engine is `SIGKILL`ed with an action in flight, and the run that
 * comes back settles exactly once.
 *
 * The action that was interrupted re-runs, because nothing durable said it
 * finished. The action that had already committed does NOT re-run, because
 * something durable said it did. Both halves are read out of an append-only
 * file the killed process could not have rewritten, and out of the run's own
 * journal.
