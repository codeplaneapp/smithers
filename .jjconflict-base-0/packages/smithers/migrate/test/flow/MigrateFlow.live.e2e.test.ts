/**
 * The migration against a real model.
 *
 * Everything else in `test/flow` proves the machinery with the seat scripted.
 * This one proves the part a script cannot: that the contract, the prompt, the
 * captured sources, and the mapping snippets are enough for a model to
 * actually rewrite a 0.x workflow into a flow that typechecks and that the
 * registry discovers.
 *
 * It runs only with credentials, and skips with a reason otherwise, because a
 * test that quietly passes without doing the thing is worse than no test. It
 * costs real money and real minutes; that is the price of knowing.
 *
 * Two variables, both documented under "Testing it against a real model" in
 * `packages/smithers/migrate/README.md`: `SMITHERS_MIGRATE_SEAT` names the
 * `provider:model` seat, and that provider's key pays for it. A key alone is
 * not enough on purpose: this package hard-codes no model id, so nothing here
 * may decide which model to spend someone's money on.
 *
 * The first case spawns the built bin, because that is what an operator runs
 * and it is the only path that exercises the flags, the exit code, and the
 * rendering together. Its `typecheck` and `test` are still overridden, and that
 * is a deviation with a reason: the migrated fixture imports
 * `@smthrs/*@1.0.0-rc.0`, which is unpublished, so a real install cannot
 * resolve it and a real typecheck cannot run until it is. Discovery, the
 * deterministic checks, and the assertions below do the measuring instead.
 * `packages/smithers/migrate/README.md` records the same thing.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
