/**
 * The fault tier: the Jujutsu pointer cases.
 *
 * The case here runs the real `jj` binary against a throwaway repository and
 * restores by change id. `jj` takes a workspace lock, so the tier runs
 * serially.
 *
 * Coverage is off. The work these cases do happens in child processes this one
 * never instruments, and `vitest.config.ts` beside this file stays the coverage
 * gate for `src`.
