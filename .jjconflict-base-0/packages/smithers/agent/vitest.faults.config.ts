/**
 * The fault tier: the checkpoint case.
 *
 * The case here takes a git checkpoint in a child process, kills it, and
 * reads the pinned tree from a fresh one. Real processes and a real git
 * checkout are machine-global, so the tier runs serially.
 *
 * Coverage is off. The work these cases do happens in child processes this one
 * never instruments, and `vitest.config.ts` beside this file stays the coverage
 * gate for `src`.
