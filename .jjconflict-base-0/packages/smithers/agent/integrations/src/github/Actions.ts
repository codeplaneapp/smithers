/**
 * The durable GitHub actions.
 *
 * {@link GitHubClient} is the host layer: it knows rate limits, pagination,
 * and token hygiene, and it is an ordinary Effect service. An `Action` is what
 * makes one of its calls a step of a durable flow, so a plan can name it, the
 * journal can record its result, and a restart replays it instead of posting
 * a second comment.
 *
 * Each action is declared here and implemented by {@link layer}. A flow body
 * calls `CommentOnIssue.call(...)`, which records a plan node and nothing
 * else; the layer is what a composition provides to make that node runnable.

 * become the request path and `new URL` resolves `..` inside one. A payload
 * built from a webhook body or a model's output therefore cannot walk the
 * token-bearing POST to another GitHub endpoint: it fails to decode.
