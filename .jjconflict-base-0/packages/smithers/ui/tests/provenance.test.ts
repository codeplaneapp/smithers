/**
 * The provenance manifests are metadata about which upstream registry item each
 * ported family came from, and which of its exports we kept. Exactly one of
 * them was verified against real code (`workflow-canvas.json`, checked inside
 * tests/workflow-canvas-components.test.tsx); the rest were free to name a
 * component that had since been renamed or deleted, because the script that was
 * supposed to check them (`scripts/check-ui-architecture.mjs`) is gone.
 *
 * This suite is the replacement. It holds two lines that do not need a script:
 * the catalog must list every lane file on disk, and every export a lane
 * declares must actually exist in the module it names.
 *
 * The check is "declared names resolve", not "declared equals runtime": the
 * manifests deliberately list type-only exports (erased before runtime) and
 * deliberately omit internal helpers a module also exports. Requiring equality
 * would fail on eleven modules for reasons that are not drift.
