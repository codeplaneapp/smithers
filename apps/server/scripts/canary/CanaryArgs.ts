/*
 * One flag reader for every canary command shell.
 *
 * The shells (build-probe, uptime-probe, uptime-report, invite-probe,
 * rollback-probe) all take `--name value` options, and each one used to
 * redeclare the same `indexOf(name) + 1` lookup. Only one of those copies
 * refused to read a following flag as a value, so `--json --samples 3` wrote a
 * report to a file called "--samples" and `--sha --max-drift 3` graded the
 * deployment against the string "--max-drift". A parser fix reached one shell
 * and left the others wrong.
 *
 * Everything here is a total function of its arguments; `argReader` is the one
 * place a shell's exit policy meets it.
