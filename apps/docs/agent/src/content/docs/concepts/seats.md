A seat is what a flow or an action declares to pick the model it runs on. It
has two halves, and they live in different places on purpose.

## The declared half

The declared half is an ordinary string, and the package ships no schema for
it. It is what a markdown flow's `model:` frontmatter carries and what
`AgentAction`'s `seat` option takes. It carries no credentials, no endpoint,
and no client: a declaration is portable, and a run that reads one out of a
repository must not be handed the keys with it.

`provider:modelId` (`anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5`) is the convention the
resolver in [`@smthrs/cli`](https://cli.smithers.sh/reference/api/) understands, not a rule the agent
enforces. Nothing below the
resolver parses the string, so a host that installs its own resolver may accept
anything it likes, including a bare model id or a logical name like `fast` or
`reviewer`.

## The resolved half

`Seat.Seat` is the resolved half, and the only thing `Agent.run` accepts: a
live `Model`, the `RouteResolver` that seals its requests, and the model's
context window in tokens so compaction has a real budget. The three arrive
together because they are one fact: the model you stream from, the route its
requests are sealed under, and the budget its answers are compacted against.
`Seat.make` constructs one, and a `SeatResolver` implementation is what calls
it. A caller reaches a seat through the resolver, never by assembling one from
a model and a route it happened to hold.

The context window must never be zero: zero is the controller's "compaction
disabled", and a resolver that resolves a window must not silently disable it.
`SeatResolver.contextWindowTokensFor` is the catalog of known models, with a
conservative floor for the rest.

## The seam between them

`SeatResolver` is the credentialed half of the composition, one method:
`resolve(id)`. The `smthrs` command line installs the resolver that reads keys
from the environment; a test installs one that answers with a scripted model
and never touches the network. Because the resolver owns the seat vocabulary,
the whole difference between a deterministic run and a live one is which
resolver is provided, and nothing above the seam changes.

A seat the host cannot serve is a typed `Seat.SeatUnresolved`, not a run that
fails halfway through. `AgentSession` resolves the declared seat at launch for
exactly this reason: a missing key refuses the launch as a typed failure
instead of failing an accepted run.
