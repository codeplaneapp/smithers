Every suite in this package runs against one real stack: a durable journal, a
durable run store, the SQL control runtime, `ControlLive`, the served
projections, the sync read path, and the assembled HTTP surface bound to an
ephemeral loopback port. Nothing below the control plane is stubbed.

That is deliberate. The behaviours worth pinning here, an approval projected
out of a parked run, a cancellation's attribution, a child run's visibility,
are exactly the places a mocked control plane would agree with the gateway and
disagree with production.

## Compose the stack

```ts
import * as NodeCrypto from "@effect/platform-node/NodeCrypto"
import * as ControlExecutor from "@smthrs/control/ControlExecutor"
import * as ControlLive from "@smthrs/control/ControlLive"
import * as SqlControlRuntime from "@smthrs/control/SqlControlRuntime"
import * as DurableWriter from "@smthrs/database/DurableWriter"
import * as NodeDatabase from "@smthrs/database/node/NodeDatabase"
import * as Projections from "@smthrs/gateway/Projections"
import { Migrations, SqlJournal } from "@smthrs/journal"
import { NotificationQueue } from "@smthrs/notifications"
import { Registry } from "@smthrs/registry"
import { Migrations as RunStoreMigrations, RunStore } from "@smthrs/run-store"
import * as RunCatalog from "@smthrs/sync/RunCatalog"
import * as SyncAuth from "@smthrs/sync/SyncAuth"
import * as SyncServer from "@smthrs/sync/SyncServer"
import * as WorkspaceShare from "@smthrs/sync/WorkspaceShare"
import { Layer } from "effect"

const storage = (filename: string) =>
  Layer.mergeAll(SqlJournal.layer({ capacity: 1024, overflow: "reject" }), RunStore.layer).pipe(
    Layer.provideMerge(
      Layer.provideMerge(
        Layer.merge(Migrations.layer, RunStoreMigrations.layer),
        Layer.provideMerge(DurableWriter.layer(), NodeDatabase.layer({ filename }))
      )
    )
  )

export const stack = (filename: string) =>
  Layer.mergeAll(
    // A short cadence, so a keepalive assertion does not wait 30 seconds.
    Projections.layerWith({ heartbeatMillis: 50 }),
    SyncServer.layer,
    SyncAuth.layer
  ).pipe(
    Layer.provideMerge(Layer.merge(RunCatalog.layerNoop, WorkspaceShare.layerNoop)),
    Layer.provideMerge(ControlLive.layer),
    Layer.provideMerge(
      Layer.mergeAll(
        SqlControlRuntime.layer({}).pipe(Layer.orDie),
        NotificationQueue.layer,
        ControlExecutor.layer(ControlExecutor.makeNoop()),
        Registry.layerNoop()
      )
    ),
    Layer.provideMerge(Layer.merge(storage(filename), NodeCrypto.layer))
  )
```

The whole helper, including the temporary-file lifecycle, is
[`test/GatewayStack.ts`](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/gateway/test/GatewayStack.ts).

## Bind an ephemeral port and read it back

```ts
import * as NodeGateway from "@smthrs/gateway/node/NodeGateway"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"
import { HttpServer } from "effect/unstable/http"

const served = NodeGateway.layer(health, { host: "127.0.0.1", port: 0 }).pipe(Layer.provideMerge(stack(filename)))

const baseUrl = Effect.map(HttpServer.HttpServer, (server) => {
  if (server.address._tag !== "TcpAddress") throw new Error("expected a TCP gateway")
  return `http://127.0.0.1:${server.address.port}`
})
```

Port 0 lets the operating system pick, and the layer retains the concrete
`HttpServer`, so a test reads the address it actually got rather than racing
for a fixed port.

## Give a run something to project

Write events through the journal's durable channel, not its lossy one:

```ts
import * as Journal from "@smthrs/journal/Journal"
import * as JournalEvent from "@smthrs/journal/JournalEvent"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const emit = (runId: string, eventType: string, payload: unknown, sourceSeq: number) =>
  Effect.flatMap(Journal.Journal, (journal) =>
    journal.emitDurableUnfenced(
      new JournalEvent.Input({
        runId: JournalEvent.RunId.make(runId),
        sourceId: JournalEvent.SourceId.make("gateway-test"),
        sourceSeq: JournalEvent.SourceSeq.make(sourceSeq),
        eventType,
        payload: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(payload))
      })
    ))
```

`emitLossy` returns once the optimistic queue accepts an entry, so a projection
read straight afterwards can legitimately miss it, and a suite built on that
races its own fixture. Give each event a monotonic `sourceSeq`, or two
identical fixture events will not both admit.

## Fold without a stack at all

A test that only cares about a fold does not need any of the above. The folds
are pure functions of a run summary and its events:

```ts
import * as GatewayProjection from "@smthrs/gateway/GatewayProjection"

const rows = GatewayProjection.runTree(run, events)
```

This is the same code the served projection runs, so a fold test and an
end-to-end test cannot disagree about what a row means. Reach for the full
stack when what you are pinning is the _serving_: a status the run row owns, a
cursor, a refusal, or an HTTP status.

## Control the supervision port

`@smthrs/gateway/test/TestSuperviseRuntime` provides a controllable
`SuperviseRuntime` for a host that needs the port without a supervisor:

```ts
import * as TestSuperviseRuntime from "@smthrs/gateway/test/TestSuperviseRuntime"

let controls: TestSuperviseRuntime.TestSuperviseRuntime
const supervision = TestSuperviseRuntime.layer({ candidates: [] }, (ready) => {
  controls = ready
})

// Later, inside the test:
await Effect.runPromise(controls.setCandidates([candidate]))
// controls.resumes records every lease the code under test took.
```

`setResumeError` makes the next resume fail with a `ResumeError`, which is how
a host's recovery branch gets exercised without a dead process to reclaim.
