`digest` and `digestSync` take text or bytes. An object is neither, so hashing
one means choosing a serialization first, and that choice is the whole
correctness question: two programs agree about a digest only when they agree,
byte for byte, about how the value was written down.

## Canonicalize, then hash

Use [`@smthrs/canonical`](https://canonical.smithers.sh/reference/api/), which implements RFC 8785 canonical
JSON. It sorts object keys by UTF-16 code unit, and it rejects values that
have no stable JSON form rather than guessing at one:

```ts
import { Canonical } from "@smthrs/canonical"
import { digest } from "@smthrs/crypto"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const digestOf = (value: unknown) =>
  Schema.decodeUnknownEffect(Canonical)(value, { reportInput: false }).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap(digest)
  )

// { a: 2, b: 1 } and { b: 1, a: 2 } serialize to {"a":2,"b":1} and share a digest.
```

`reportInput: false` keeps the value out of any schema issue, which matters as
soon as the thing you are hashing might be credentials or a multi-megabyte
payload.

## What you must not do instead

Building the bytes by hand is where digests go wrong. Two structured values
that are genuinely different can produce identical bytes:

```ts
import { digestSync } from "@smthrs/crypto"

// Do not do this: ("ab", "c") and ("a", "bc") hash identically.
digestSync(`${namespace}${name}`)
```

If you are joining strings rather than canonicalizing a value, separate them
with a byte that cannot occur in either part, and include a domain and a
version in the material so identities from different protocols cannot
overlap:

```ts
digestSync(`flow-key/v1\0${namespace}\0${name}`)
```

This is the ambiguity the package cannot protect you from: it hashes exactly
the bytes it is given. See
[the contract](/contract/#what-the-package-does-not-defend-against).

## Reach for the package that already did this

Do not re-derive a format that exists. [`@smthrs/keys`](https://keys.smithers.sh/reference/api/) is
canonicalization plus SHA-256 plus a versioned `key1_` prefix, with typed
failures for both halves:

```ts
import { deriveKey } from "@smthrs/keys"

deriveKey({ domain: "step", flow: "build", payload })
// Effect<KeyV1, KeyDerivationError, Crypto.Crypto>
```

[`@smthrs/artifacts`](https://artifacts.smithers.sh/reference/api/) is the same idea for bytes: an address
plus a store that verifies it on every read.

## Compose the Sha256 schema

Where the boundary is naturally a schema rather than a function call, `Sha256`
is the transformation from `string | Uint8Array` to `Digest`:

```ts
import * as NodeCrypto from "@effect/platform-node/NodeCrypto"
import { Sha256 } from "@smthrs/crypto"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const Manifest = Schema.Struct({
  name: Schema.String,
  contents: Sha256 // decodes text or bytes into a Digest
})

Effect.runPromise(
  Schema.decodeUnknownEffect(Manifest)({ name: "server.js", contents: "hello" }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(NodeCrypto.layer)
  )
)
// {
//   name: "server.js",
//   contents: "2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824"
// }
```

Three behaviours of this schema are deliberate:

- **It requires a `Crypto` service.** Decoding runs `digest`, so use
  `Schema.decodeUnknownEffect` and provide a host. There is no synchronous
  decode.
- **It never reports its input.** The schema sets `reportInput: false`, which
  overrides a caller that asked for input reporting, so hashed material cannot
  leak into a schema issue held by an enclosing schema.
- **It refuses to encode.** Encoding fails with
  `A digest cannot be converted back into its source bytes`, because a digest
  cannot reconstruct what produced it.

Operational failures become `SchemaError` issues whose message is
`[code] message` and whose annotations keep the typed `Sha256Error` as
`cause`, so a handler can still branch on the stable code.
