## Install the package

```bash
pnpm add @smthrs/keys
```

The package requires Node.js 22.19.0 or later and ships as ESM and CommonJS
with TypeScript declarations. Three runtime dependencies install with it:
[`effect`](https://effect.website) for the schema runtime,
[`@smthrs/canonical`](https://canonical.smithers.sh/reference/api/) for the serialization, and
[`@smthrs/crypto`](https://crypto.smithers.sh/reference/api/) for the digest. There are no others, and the
package's own suite fails if one appears.

## Provide a Crypto service

`deriveKey` and `DerivedKey` return an Effect that requires
`Crypto.Crypto` from `effect/Crypto`. The package imports no `node:` builtin
and ships no implementation of its own, which is what lets the same source
bundle for a browser. You choose where the hashing happens.

On Node.js or Bun, use the platform layer:

```ts
import * as NodeCrypto from "@effect/platform-node/NodeCrypto"
import { deriveKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const program = deriveKey({ domain: "docs/install", version: 1 }).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeCrypto.layer)
)
```

Where you want no platform dependency at all, `@smthrs/crypto` ships a
synchronous SHA-256-only service. It refuses randomness and every other digest
algorithm, so use it for identity construction and supply a real platform layer
for anything else:

```ts
import { syncCrypto } from "@smthrs/crypto"
import { deriveKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
import * as Crypto from "effect/Crypto"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

const key = Effect.runSync(
  deriveKey({ domain: "docs/install", version: 1 }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(Layer.succeed(Crypto.Crypto)(syncCrypto))
  )
)
```

In a browser, compose `BrowserCrypto` from `@effect/platform-browser`, or the
synchronous service above. `@smthrs/platform-browser` deliberately omits
`Crypto`, so it does not pick for you.

`StoredKey`, `KeyV1`, and `digest` require no `Crypto` service. A boundary that
only validates keys installs nothing.

## Import forms

The root entry point re-exports the whole module:

```ts
import { DerivedKey, deriveKey, digest, KeyDerivationError, KeyV1, StoredKey } from "@smthrs/keys"
```

The module is also importable from its own subpath:

```ts
import * as Key from "@smthrs/keys/Key"
```

Two subpath forms are blocked in the export map and are not public:
`@smthrs/keys/internal/*` and `@smthrs/keys/*/index`.
`@smthrs/keys/package.json` is exported.

## Next step

Derive a key, store it, and read it back in the [Quickstart](/quickstart/).
