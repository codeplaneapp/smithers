Every operation on `Jj` fails with a `JjError` carrying a stable `code`, the
`module` and `method` that failed, a human `message`, the `command` that
produced it, and an optional `cause`. Nothing escapes as an untyped throw: a
`node:child_process` spawn that dies synchronously, a Rust panic inside the
WebAssembly module, and a repository that refuses an operation all arrive the
same way.

## The four codes are a closed contract

| Code            | Meaning                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `not_installed` | No usable jj on this host.                            |
| `conflict`      | The repository refused: the operation would conflict. |
| `invalid_ref`   | The change id or revision does not resolve.           |
| `unknown`       | Everything else jj reported.                          |

Callers branch on these, step keys digest them, and user interfaces map them to
remediation. A code is added and never repurposed. Widening `conflict` to cover
a new situation would silently change what an already-recorded run means.

## Classification is one definition, shared by every layer

The Node adapter reads jj's own stderr vocabulary and maps it onto the four
codes, the same way `NodeFileSystem` maps errno. Two details in that mapping
exist because the naive version was wrong:

- The revision vocabulary is anchored. `Path doesn't exist` and
  `Revision "x" doesn't exist` are both jj sentences, and only the second is
  `invalid_ref`.
- The conflict vocabulary matches only on a line jj opened as a diagnostic
  (`Error:` or `Caused by:`) and only where `conflict` is a whole word. A bare
  substring test read a ref named `conflict-fix` or a path named
  `docs/conflict-resolution.md` as a conflicted repository, and it did so ahead
  of the revision check, so a genuinely invalid ref was journaled under the
  wrong durable code.

Some failures never reach jj at all. An empty revision string is `invalid_ref`
before anything is spawned, because jj's own answer would be an argument-parser
usage error that classifies as `unknown`, and the WebAssembly layer guards the
same case in Rust.

That agreement is the point, and it is tested rather than asserted:
[test/LayerParity.test.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/smithers/blob/main/packages/smithers/flows/jj/test/LayerParity.test.ts)
drives one table of failures through both the CLI layer and the wasm layer and
requires the same code from each. A run that snapshots through one backend and
replays against the other needs the same code for the same failure, or a branch
on it takes a different arm.

## The cause is data, not an Error

`JjError` round-trips through the journal, and a journal round trip is
`JSON.stringify` at some point. An `Error` stringifies to `{}`, because `name`,
`message`, and `stack` are non-enumerable, so a `cause` holding the live object
would arrive on the other side of a replay with its message gone.

`JjErrorCause` is therefore three plain fields copied out at construction:
`name` (the failure's constructor or tag name), `code` (the errno-style string,
such as `ENOENT`), and `message`. `jjErrorCause(cause)` is the supported
projection from an arbitrary host failure onto that shape.

Bounding it is the second job. A live `PlatformError` carries argv, and an
arbitrary object can be cyclic or mutable, so every field is capped at
`causeMessageLimit` (1024 characters, with the ellipsis inside the budget). The
schema enforces the bound in both directions: `new JjError` throws on an
over-length field, and the journal decoder rejects an over-length record.

## Everything else that could be unbounded is bounded too

A diagnostic must not become a payload, so each of these has a stated ceiling:

- The `command` on a Node failure is the argv rendered back as the line a human
  would have typed, capped at 512 characters. A caller-supplied `snapshot`
  message cannot drag an arbitrary payload into a journaled error through it.
- One jj invocation buffers at most 64 MiB of each output stream, counted in
  bytes as they arrive rather than in decoded characters, so the bound is the
  same for a diff of Japanese source as for one of ASCII. Past the ceiling the
  child is killed and the operation fails with `unknown`. Both Node layers
  apply the identical ceiling, because routing jj through the host's spawner
  must not change what a caller observes.
- The WebAssembly layer quotes at most 256 characters of an unusable ABI
  response back in its error message.

## Telling jj's refusal from the kernel's

`JjFailure` is a union, so a caller that wants to branch narrows first:

```ts
import { isJjError, Jj } from "@smthrs/jj"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const codeOf = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const jj = yield* Jj
  const failure = yield* Effect.flip(jj.restore("nosuchchange"))
  return isJjError(failure) ? failure.code : "denied"
})
```

`isJjError` matches on the durable `_tag`, so it keeps working across the
kernel's decorator and across a journal round trip. Reading `.code` off the
union without narrowing is a type error, which is deliberate: "jj said no" and
"the capability kernel said no" call for different handling.

Every code, its usual causes, and the fix are in
[Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/).
