A step declares which files it reads and which it writes. `StepBoundary` is the
service that measures that declaration against reality: before the step runs,
after it runs, and again when a later replay has to reproduce its outputs on a
workspace that never executed anything.

The declaration itself is `FileBoundary`, from
[`@smthrs/flow`](https://flow.smithers.sh/reference/api/)'s `Action` namespace: a `readSet`, a `writeSet`,
optional `removes`, and a `boundaryMode` of `hard` or `expected`.

## The three calls

```ts
interface Service {
  readonly prepare: (descriptor: FileBoundary) => Effect<PreparedBoundary, UnsupportedBoundary, Crypto>
  readonly settle: (prepared: PreparedBoundary) => Effect<BoundaryEvidence, SettleError, Crypto>
  readonly replayOutputs: (evidence: BoundaryEvidence) => Effect<void, ReplayError, Crypto>
}
```

`prepare` measures the declared read set's real digests and returns a
`PreparedBoundary` carrying the descriptor plus a `readSnapshot`. The declared
digests in the descriptor are caller metadata folded into the step key; the
snapshot is the evidence that they still describe reality.

`settle` measures the writes afterwards and turns them into
`BoundaryEvidence`: the declared outputs (as a replayable payload), a
`diffIdentity` naming the post-state, and two optional honest flags,
`wholeTreeWritesVerified` and `hermeticReadsVerified`.

`replayOutputs` reproduces those outputs from the evidence.

## Hard mode refuses, expected mode records

The same observation produces a refusal in `hard` mode and a `BoundaryDeviation`
in `expected` mode:

| Observation                                                            | Hard mode                  | Expected mode                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Wrote outside the declared write set                                   | `UndeclaredWrite`          | `ExpectedSetDeviation`               |
| Did not produce a declared output, and did not declare it as a removal | `MissingDeclaredOutput`    | `MissingDeclaredOutput` deviation    |
| Left a declared removal in place                                       | `SurvivingDeclaredRemoval` | `SurvivingDeclaredRemoval` deviation |

The two absence cases exist for a specific reason. Recording `digest: null` as
valid evidence caches the claim "this file should not exist", which
`replayOutputs` then acts on by deleting the path on a workspace that never ran
the step. A step that crashed after declaring its writes would poison the cache
with an eraser. Declaring a path in `removes` is how a deliberate deletion says
so, and it is the only thing that makes an absence legitimate.

A deviation of any variant bars the evidence from the shared cache, so an
unexplained absence never reaches another host either way. Deviations go to
[`Reconciliation`](/guides/drive-a-plan/), which answers with a verdict.

## Inline, or spilled by digest

Outputs are recorded by content digest, never inlined without bound. Two limits
on `FileSystemOptions` decide:

- `maxInlineBytes`, the largest single output carried inline in the evidence.
  Defaults to 1 MiB.
- `maxTotalInlineBytes`, the largest aggregate inline payload one settle may
  fold into its evidence. Defaults to 8 MiB. A per-output bound alone still let
  a wide write set multiply many individually small payloads into an unbounded
  evidence row.

Anything past either bound is handed to the `ArtifactStore` and recorded by
digest reference only. `referencedDigests(evidence)` names exactly those
digests: the set a shared tier must hold before the evidence's cache entry
becomes observable there, and the set a replay on a fresh host has to fetch.

The blob mechanics, content addressing, atomic publication, digest
verification, and dedupe, belong to [`@smthrs/artifacts`](https://artifacts.smithers.sh/reference/api/). What
stays here is the policy that decides which outputs become blobs at all.

## Why the production boundary cannot claim the whole tree by itself

`StepBoundary.layer` is the filesystem-backed boundary over the kernel
`FileSystem` seam and the artifact store. It measures declared paths. It cannot
see a write elsewhere in the tree, so it never claims
`wholeTreeWritesVerified` on its own, and a composition with a boundary but no
sandbox keeps the honest outcome: run-local results only.

The whole-tree proof comes from running the body somewhere else. That is
[`WorkspaceSandbox`](/concepts/workspace-transactions/): the transaction is the tree,
so a write outside the declared set is a map comparison rather than an
inference, and `ActionPersistence` sets the flag structurally.

`StepBoundary.layerTest(options)` is deterministic and supports
explicit `failure` or `deviation` fixtures, replay, and `readSnapshot` assertions, but it does not
enforce a real sandbox. Its `wholeTreeWriteDetection` default of `true` is a
fixture, not a proof.

## Replay refusals a caller can act on

`replayOutputs` distinguishes three failures on purpose:

- `MissingArtifact`: the bytes are simply not on this host. A shared artifact
  tier can repair it, so `ArtifactSync.hydrate` fetches and the dispatch
  retries the replay exactly once before falling through to a real execution.
- `BoundaryCorruption`: the bytes are here and no longer hash to their recorded
  digest. That is an integrity violation, not a transient failure.
- `UnsupportedBoundary`: the host could not honour the boundary at all. It is
  the catch-all, and it carries the refusing host or store failure whole in
  `cause` rather than flattened into the message.

Test filesystem classification with `StepBoundary.layer` over an in-memory `FileSystem` and `ArtifactStore`. `layerTest` returns supplied settlement evidence or failure verbatim; it does not classify changed paths, missing outputs, or surviving removals.
