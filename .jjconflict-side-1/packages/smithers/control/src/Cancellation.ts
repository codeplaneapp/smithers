/**
 * Cancellation attribution as the control plane reads it back.
 *
 * A cancellation is durable but anonymous. `flows_runs.cancel_requested_at_ms`
 * records that somebody asked, and nothing in the row records who, why, or
 * whether the run was asked at all rather than swept up in an ancestor's
 * cascade. Three journals hold the missing halves: the control plane's own
 * `control.run.cancel-requested`, the engine's `flows.engine.interrupted`, and
 * the ancestry the run store already keeps. This module folds them into one
 * answer per run.
 *
 * The fold is pure and scope-independent: it reads whatever evidence it is
 * handed and never issues a query, so the caller chooses how much to read.
 * `SqlControlRuntime` uses two scopes. A listing folds the whole database,
 * because every row is going to be answered for anyway. A single-run read
 * folds only that run and its ancestor chain, which is the smallest scope that
 * can still answer the question: cascade is a fact about a run's ancestors, so
 * it cannot be decided one row at a time — a child's cancellation is
 * attributed to whoever asked for its nearest cancelled ancestor's, however
 * many rounds up that is.
 *
 * The two foreign event types are named as strings rather than imported,
 * exactly as in {@link Lineage}: a control plane reads journals, not engines.
 *

/**
 * Attributes every cancelled run in one pass.

 * Three sources, in the order a run's own evidence outranks its ancestors':
 *
 * 1. A `control.run.cancel-requested` entry names this run. Somebody asked for
 *    this run by name, and the entry says who and why.
 * 2. A cancelled ancestor exists. The run was swept up in that cancellation,
 *    so it reports `cascade`, names the ancestor whose request started it, and
 *    inherits that request's principal and reason — the honest answer to "who
 *    cancelled this child" is the operator who cancelled its parent.
 * 3. Neither. The engine cancelled the run on its own account: a lease
 *    expiry, a budget, a supervisor. There is no principal to report, and
 *    inventing one would be worse than saying nothing.
 *
 * The ancestor walk carries a visited set. A cyclic parent chain is not
 * reachable through the engine's cycle detection, but a projection that hung
 * on corrupt ancestry would take the control plane down with it.
