/**
 * A cancelled run has to say so in its own journal.
 *
 * `smithers run` keeps its process alive after the receipt is printed, because
 * a local CLI owns the executor and a driver interrupted at the prompt is a
 * run abandoned mid-flight. `Command.ts` `settled` is the whole exit
 * condition: the process waits for `control.run.completed`, `failed`,
 * `cancelled`, `waiting-approval`, or `pending` on the run's journal, and
 * returns on the first one.
 *
 * `control.run.cancelled` had no writer. `Control.cancel` journals
 * `control.run.cancel-requested`, the attribution record, and then transitions
 * the row through `ControlRuntime.interrupt`, which writes no journal event;
 * `AgentSession.settle` deliberately writes none either, because the control
 * operation owns a cancellation's terminal write. So a detached `smithers up`
 * whose run was cancelled by a second process waited for an event nothing
 * emits: the release validation's pid 10105, alive at 0.1 % CPU four and a half
 * minutes after its only run reached `Terminal cancelled`, killed by hand.
