 * closed code set; that service is gone — process execution is Effect's
 * `ChildProcessSpawner` — so the seam declares what a *remote session* can go
 * wrong with and `layer` normalizes those onto `PlatformError`. Provider
 * packages may add SDK details to `cause`, but cannot create new Host-visible
 * failure kinds.
 *
 * `not_found` entered the set with the `Sandbox` session contract: a session
 * that can read files back needs an honest answer for a path that holds
 * nothing, and overloading `unknown` would make "absent" indistinguishable
 * from "broken" at the one seam whose job is to keep them apart.
