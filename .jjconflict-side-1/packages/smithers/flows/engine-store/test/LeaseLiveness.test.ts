/**
 * A fresh process reclaims a hard-killed owner with no application code.
 *
 * `EngineStore.Options.isAlive` used to be required, so the durable engine
 * could not answer its own liveness question: a deployment that had nothing
 * but the persisted lease still had to write a probe, and one that wrote
 * `() => Effect.succeed(true)` to be safe could never recover from a SIGKILL
 * at all. The default is now the lease itself
 * (`Ownership.leaseLiveness`) — the owner is alive while its heartbeat is
 * younger than `heartbeatStaleAfter`, and gone once it is not — and the steal
 * it admits carries `lease-expired` evidence the store verifies in the same
 * write.
 *
 * Real SQLite, because the evidence being reasoned about (a `running` row with
 * a frozen `heartbeat_at_ms`) lives in `flows_runs`.
