/**
 * Builds the liveness probe `EngineStore` consults before it steals a run.
 *
 * The engine asks this before taking a run whose recorded owner it is not, so
 * a wrong `true` strands a run and a wrong `false` runs it twice. The rule is
 * therefore asymmetric on purpose:
 *
 * - An owner from a **different host** is alive. A pid means nothing across
 *   machines, and the process table this probe reads is only this machine's.
 * - An owner from **this host** is alive exactly while its pid is signalable.
 *   That is the same question {@link ProcessReaper} asks about an abandoned
 *   process group, and the same answer: a pid that is gone is gone.
 *
 * The residual risk is pid reuse. An owner whose pid was recycled by an
 * unrelated program reads as alive and its run waits for an operator, which is
 * the safe direction: nothing about a recycled pid can tell this process
 * whether the run is still being driven, and the cost of guessing wrong the
 * other way is two hosts executing one run.
 *
 * A multi-process deployment with a supervisor or a lease system knows better
 * than any pid probe and should answer from that instead.
 *
 * **There is a second shipped implementation of this slot, and it disagrees.**
 * `@smthrs/run-store`'s `Ownership.sameHostPidProbe` fills the same
 * `LivenessCheck` and answers the OPPOSITE question on two inputs:
 *
 * - an owner on a DIFFERENT `hostId`. `sameHostPidProbe` returns `false`, so the
 *   run is reclaimable; this returns `true`, so a permanently dead foreign
 *   host's runs are stranded until an operator intervenes.
 * - a signal error that is neither `ESRCH` nor `EPERM`. `sameHostPidProbe`
 *   returns `code === "EPERM"`, so that error reads as DEAD; this returns
 *   `code !== "ESRCH"`, so the same error reads as ALIVE.
 *
 * Which answer a deployment gets depends on the entry point it used:
 * `@smthrs/flows`' `NodeRuntime` defaults to this function, while
 * `@smthrs/cli`'s `NodeControl` passes `sameHostPidProbe`. This function also
 * returns a ONE-argument function, which is structurally accepted as an
 * `Ownership.LivenessCheck` and silently discards the `context` argument the
 * sibling reads. Reconciling the two is open work, tracked as B-09 in
 * `docs/pages/release/support-matrix.md`.
