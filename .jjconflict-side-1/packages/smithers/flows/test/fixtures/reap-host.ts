/**
 * A host program that starts a process group and then waits to be killed.
 *
 * It exists to be `SIGKILL`ed. A host that is signalled runs its finalizers and
 * takes its children with it; a host that is KILLED runs nothing, and what it
 * spawned survives with nobody holding a handle to it. That is the only state
 * in which the `ProcessReaper` has anything to do, and the only honest way to
 * produce it is to kill a real host process from outside.
 *
 * Usage: `node reap-host.ts <sqlite file> <hostId> <executionId>`. It prints the
 * pid of the process group it started, then waits.
