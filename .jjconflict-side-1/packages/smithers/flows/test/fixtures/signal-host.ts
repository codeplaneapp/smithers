/**
 * A host program that shuts down on a signal, for the integration test to kill.
 *
 * It is a separate process on purpose. `SIGTERM` to a Vitest worker is not the
 * thing under test — a real deployment sends the signal to a program that owns
 * its process — and the only honest way to observe what that program leaves in
 * the database is to be a different process from it.
 *
 * Usage: `node signal-host.ts <sqlite file> <executionId> [hang] [timeoutMs]`.
 * It prints the run's status once the run is actually running, then waits to be
 * signalled. In `hang` mode the action's interruption never returns, so the
 * graceful shutdown cannot finish and the handler's escapes are the only way
 * this process ever exits.
