/**
 * What a `SIGTERM` leaves behind.
 *
 * A host that is killed while it drives a run has one job: leave the run
 * reclaimable. `layerHost` installs the handler that does it, and the handler
 * closes the runtime scope rather than killing the process, so the engine's
 * own release path runs and the row ends `suspended` with a `released` reason
 * instead of `running` behind a dead owner until a sweep notices.
 *
 * The program under test is a real child process (`test/fixtures/signal-host.ts`).
 * Sending `SIGTERM` to this worker would test Vitest, and reading the database
 * from inside the process that wrote it would prove nothing about what
 * survived the shutdown.
