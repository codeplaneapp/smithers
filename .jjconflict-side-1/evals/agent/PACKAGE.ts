/**
 * Targets for the offline agent evaluation suite.
 *
 * The suite is a program whose exit code is the verdict — it scores the agent
 * against `baseline.json` and fails on drift — so it is a test target, and its
 * own typecheck is a build target. Both run from this directory, which is a
 * workspace member (`@smthrs/eval-agent`): `tsc` resolves through the declared
 * package manager against the `typescript` and `@types/node` this package pins,
 * and the suite names the Bun runtime, so neither `bun` nor `npx` is spelled
 * anywhere.
 *
 * There is no `lint` or `fmt` target, and adding one would break the suite
 * rather than tidy it. `baseline.json` is the canonical JSON `Baseline.write`
 * emits byte for byte, and the repository's dprint configuration reformats it,
 * so a formatting gate here would permanently disagree with the program that
 * writes the artifact.
