/**
 * What an alerter still knows after the process that paged died.
 *
 * `Alerts.test.ts` runs every durability case over one in-memory journal and
 * one `AlertRuntime`, which cannot separate "the delivery record works" from
 * "the runtime remembered". An in-memory database dies with the runtime that
 * opened it, so the two are never apart. These cases run over a real file,
 * close the first stack completely, and build a SECOND runtime over the same
 * rows.
 *
 * The clock is the real one on purpose. A restart is exactly the situation
 * where the wall clock has moved between the page and the tick that follows
 * it, and an alert whose content varied with the reading time would be refused
 * by the queue as an idempotency conflict on the second process's first tick.
