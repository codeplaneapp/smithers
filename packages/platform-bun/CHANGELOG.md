# @smthrs/platform-bun

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `BunHost.BunHostError`, the refusal `BunHost.layerAt` and
  `BunHost.layerContainedAt` throw for a root that is not absolute, the empty
  string included. It carries the stable code `invalid_repository_root`
  (`BunHost.BunHostErrorCode`), names the Bun factory that refused, and repeats
  at most 64 characters of the root. Both factories used to hand the root
  straight to the `Jj` adapter, which threw a bare `TypeError` naming
  `NodeJj.layerAt` or `NodeJj.layerSpawnerAt`, carried no code, and echoed the
  whole string.

## [1.0.0-rc.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Initial extraction from the dissolved `@smthrs/host`. `BunHost` and
  `BunFileSystem` moved here unchanged in behaviour; `BunJj` had already moved
  to `@smthrs/jj` and is composed from there.
- `BunHost.layerAt` and `BunHost.layerContainedAt` bind `Jj` to one absolute
  repository root, so a host does not inherit the process working directory.
- `BunFileSystem.layer` is `@smthrs/platform-node`'s `AtomicFileSystem.layer`,
  the same implementation behind `NodeHost`'s filesystem slot. Guarded path
  operations under `@smthrs/kernel`'s `FileSystem.layer` are therefore
  descriptor-relative and no-follow on Bun, not failing closed. The host needs a
  CPython 3 interpreter at `/usr/bin/python3`; `BunFileSystem.layerWith` names a
  different one, and `BunHost` re-exports `AtomicFileSystem` for parity with
  `NodeHost`.
- `engines.bun` declares the supported Bun floor, `>=1.3.0`.

### Changed

- `BunHost.layerContained` and `BunHost.layerContainedAt` take
  `BunHost.ContainedOptions`, which is `ContainedSpawner.Options` without
  `platform`, plus `ProcessReaper.Options`. The spawner always gets the real
  `process.platform`: a caller-supplied `"win32"` on a POSIX host used to win
  the spread and record `pgid: null` for a child that genuinely leads a process
  group, and `ProcessReaper.reap` retires such a record as `no-group` without
  signalling anything, so the orphan outlived every incarnation. Both halves are
  now read when the factory is called rather than when the layer is built, so
  mutating the object afterwards cannot change what either layer was built with.
- `BunHost.implementationIds` names `@smthrs/platform-node/AtomicFileSystem` for
  the filesystem slot, which is the module actually behind it, and writes every
  key as a literal so reordering `HostServiceIds` cannot mis-pair a slot with
  another slot's implementation. No planner reads the record yet, so the change
  invalidates no cached step.

### Removed

- `BunHttpTransport` is gone, and with it the dependency on
  `@smthrs/platform-browser` that existed only to borrow a `fetch`-backed
  transport. An outgoing request is Effect's `HttpClient`, and `BunHost.layer`
  now provides `@effect/platform-bun`'s own `BunHttpClient.layer` with
  `RequestInit { redirect: "manual" }`, so nothing follows a redirect behind
  the capability kernel's back. `BunHost.implementationIds` names
  `@effect/platform-bun/BunHttpClient` for the network slot.

- `BunShell` is gone, and with it the hand-rolled runtime detection that chose
  between `Bun.spawn` and `node:child_process`. `BunHost.layer` provides
  `@effect/platform-bun`'s `ChildProcessSpawner`, which is
  `@effect/platform-node-shared`'s implementation re-exported, the same code on
  both runtimes, so there is nothing left to detect.
