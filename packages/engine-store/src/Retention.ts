/**
 * Deleting run history that has outlived its usefulness.
 *
 * Nothing in the durable stores forgets on its own: a finished run keeps its
 * row, every attempt, every journal event, and every archived frame forever.
 * That is the right default — a run's history is the only account of what an
 * agent did to a repository — and it is why `smithers gc` exists rather than a
 * background sweeper. Retention is an operator decision, taken explicitly,
 * with a dry run available before anything is deleted.
 *
 * This module is the public surface. The operation lives in
 * `internal/RetentionOps.ts` beside the other modules that read this package's
 * own tables, so `internal/` is never imported by a consumer — the same split
 * `Errors.ts` uses. {@link retain} and {@link layer} are that operation: one
 * bounded pass over the engine ladder, inside one `journal.transact`.
 *
 * {@link collect} is the host-facing pass `smithers gc` runs, and it is a
 * facade over the same guard. A project keeps its history in two files — the
 * control plane's database and the engine's — and a sweep of one without the
 * other leaves half of a deleted run behind, so the pass takes the database as
 * a service and runs once per file. Which runs it may delete is
 * {@link RetentionOps.lineagePrelude}'s answer, not a second guard written
 * here: a run stays whenever a live run stands above or below it, over BOTH
 * relations that make one run the parent of another — the `flows_run_parents`
 * edge a spawned child records, and the `parent_run_id` column a trampoline
 * lineage is chained through.
 *
 * Only terminal runs are ever considered. A `pending`, `running`, or
 * `suspended` row belongs to work that can still resume.
