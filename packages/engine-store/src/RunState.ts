 * The envelope a durable run's state is persisted inside.

 * struct, so a store row written by an older build decodes under a known
 * shape instead of being guessed at. `version` is a literal rather than a
 * number for exactly that reason: a future revision adds a new literal and
 * both remain decodable.
 *
 * Time travel reads these rows too, deriving the state AT a frame by
 * replaying run-decision records rather than trusting the row's latest value.

 * shape a fire-and-forget spawn takes: the parent deliberately did not wait,
 * so the child outlives it and keeps its own claim and its own journal.
 *
 * The policy is recorded on the CHILD rather than on the edge because it is a
 * property of how the child was started, and because a child with two parents
 * (the diamond `flows_run_parents` permits) must answer the question once.
