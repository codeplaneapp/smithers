/**
 * Value predicates a host can answer without running the value's own code.
 *
 * Projecting a settlement the flow's codec rejected must not execute user
 * code. A `Proxy` runs its handler on every reflective read, and the point of
 * `./ExitEncoding.ts` is to describe the value a round is already failing on,
 * not to hand that value another turn on the terminal-transition path. Node
 * answers the question from an internal slot, through `node:util/types`. No
 * ECMAScript operation does: virtualization is transparent by design, so a
 * proxy and its target are indistinguishable to portable code.
 *
 * Binding `node:util/types` with a static import states that answer as a
 * build-time dependency, and that is wrong twice. `@smthrs/engine-store` is a
 * browser entry point in `docs/migration/rc-contract.md` section 3.1 and in
 * `scripts/browser-contract.mjs`, so the import fails `pnpm run browser`; and
 * it claims a capability every host has, which is false. This module reads the
 * predicates off the host instead, the way `../OwnerIdentity.ts` reads a
 * process id: `process.getBuiltinModule` when the host offers it, portable
 * fallbacks when it does not. Node and Bun both take the first path, so on the
 * runtimes the durable engine supports the behavior is exactly what the static
 * import gave. A browser takes the second, where proxy detection does not
 * exist and this module says so rather than pretending.
 *
 * The lookup grants no authority, which is why it is resolved here rather than
 * routed through a `HostServices` port. The whole surface of
 * `node:util/types` is predicates over values already in hand: no filesystem,
 * no process, no clock, no randomness. A port exists to keep nondeterminism
 * and I/O out of a composition, and a pure type test is neither.
 *
