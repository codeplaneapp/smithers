/**
 * N-07: `execute` against a hard-killed run reclaims the lease itself.
 *
 * The parity audit's extra finding 3 said an `execute` naming the execution id
 * of a run whose owner was SIGKILLed neither reclaims the expired lease nor
 * fails typed, leaving only the ~30 s stale-running sweep to notice. What that
 * would mean in practice is an operator re-running a flow after a crash and
 * watching nothing happen for half a minute.
 *
 * It does reclaim, and these cases pin it against the real SQLite stores, with
 * the sweep held still so the only thing that can take the run over is the
 * `execute` call itself. They also pin the other side, which is the reason
 * this is a lease and not a takeover: while the dead owner's lease is still
 * inside its window, `execute` does not steal the run.
 *
 * Uses the SQL `DurableEngineState` over the same database as `RunStore`,
 * because the hard-kill evidence — a `running` row with a frozen
 * `heartbeat_at_ms` and no waiting row — lives in `flows_runs` itself.
