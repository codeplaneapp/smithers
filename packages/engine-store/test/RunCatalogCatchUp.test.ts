/**
 * The catch-up read behind a workspace follower's run catalog.
 *
 * `@smthrs/sync` serves a workspace subscription over whatever `RunCatalog`
 * the composition supplies, and every implementation of it was static or
 * in-process: a follower learned about the runs its own process registered and
 * about nothing a second engine wrote to the same workspace. This module is
 * the durable half of the fix: the read that says which runs the workspace
 * has right now. These cases drive it across two independent compositions
 * over one database file, which is what a second engine actually looks like.
