/**
 * A run that ends on its own terms takes its attached children with it.
 *
 * Cancellation already cascaded (`CancelCascade.test.ts`), but the other two
 * terminal outcomes did not: a parent that COMPLETED or FAILED left every
 * linked child row exactly as it was. A `.child()` boundary whose parent died
 * on an unrelated branch therefore left a durable orphan — parked forever,
 * owned by nobody, waited for by nobody, and reachable only by an operator who
 * knew its id.
 *
 * The fix is a policy the child records for itself at spawn
 * (`RunState.onParentExit`) and the parent applies inside its own terminal
 * compare-and-swap. `cancel` is the default and what a caller that waits for
 * the child's value gets; `detach` is what a caller that discarded the result
 * gets, because outliving the parent is the point of a fire-and-forget spawn.
 *
 * Real SQLite, because the property under test is that the child's
 * cancellation and the parent's terminal row commit together: under the
 * in-memory engine state `transaction` is a pass-through and the claim would
 * be untestable.
