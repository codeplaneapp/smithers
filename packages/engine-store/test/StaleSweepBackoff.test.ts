/**
 * B-04: what the stale-running sweep costs when the owners are alive.
 *
 * `staleRunningRuns` is `ORDER BY heartbeat_at_ms, run_id LIMIT 64` with no
 * cursor, and the sweep woke that same batch every heartbeat. When the probe
 * answers "the owner is alive" the batch never drains, so two things went
 * wrong at once: the sixty-fifth stale row was never probed at all — the
 * oldest sixty-four are ahead of it forever — and every refusal wrote a
 * durable journal record through the default source id, one row per refused
 * run per second, for as long as the owners stayed alive.
 *
 * Both are fixed by remembering the refusal: a run whose owner was just proven
 * alive is not re-probed until its backoff elapses, which is what lets the
 * batch move past it, and the refusal record is addressed by
 * `(run, owner, heartbeat)` so the journal admits it once.
 *
 * Uses the SQL `DurableEngineState` over the same database as `RunStore`,
 * because the evidence is `flows_runs` itself.
