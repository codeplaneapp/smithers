# @smthrs/engine

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-rc.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Added the coded engine refusals `FlowEngine.FlowNotRegistered`,
  `ExecutionIdentityConflict`, `SuspendedResumeGaveUp`, and
  `SnapshotBoundaryRequired`, so an admission or configuration defect carries a
  stable `code` and structured fields instead of a bare string or a generic
  `Error`.
- Added `FlowProxy.InvalidFlowTag` for a flow tag that is not well-formed
  UTF-16, which route construction previously reported as a name collision.
- Added package-owned documentation under `packages/engine/docs`, generated
  into `docs/pages/api/engine.md` by the `//packages/engine:docsPages` target.

### Breaking Changes

- Split the flow authoring model out into `@smthrs/flow`. `Flow`, `Action`,
  `RetryPolicy`, `DurableDeferred`, `DurableClock`, `DurableQueue`, and
  `StepIdentity` are no longer exported here; import them from `@smthrs/flow`.
- The `FlowEngine.FlowEngine` service and `FlowEngine.FlowInstance` moved to
  `@smthrs/flow` as `FlowRuntime.FlowRuntime` and `FlowRuntime.FlowInstance`,
  together with `annotateWaiting`, `WaitingAnnotation`, and
  `FlowCycleDetected`. `@smthrs/engine` implements that port; the dependency
  direction is now `@smthrs/flow` ← `@smthrs/engine`, with no cycle.
- `FlowEngine.FlowInstance.initial(flow, executionId)` is now
  `FlowEngine.makeInstance(flow, executionId)`.

### Changed

- Broke the single `FlowEngine.ts` module into a `FlowEngine/` folder:
  `Encoded.ts`, `SnapshotBoundary.ts`, `FlowInstance.ts`, `ActionKey.ts`,
  `make.ts`, `layerMemory.ts`, and the barrel.

- Renamed `Flow.withCompensation` to `Flow.withRollback` in the new
  `@smthrs/flow` authoring package.
- Moved `BoundaryMode` beside the `Action` model it configures in
  `@smthrs/flow`.
- Split the `Flow` and `Action` implementations into focused modules while
  moving their public imports to `@smthrs/flow`.

### Fixed

- Scoped sealed action keys to one run until the composition declares its
  complete layer and capability identity.
- Made in-memory action execution single-flight, snapshotted replay payloads,
  and encoded deferred and clock addresses as injective tuples.
- Made journal lineage and trampoline-round identities injective and added
  typed validation for malformed round bounds.
- Refused colliding proxy operation names and encoded every HTTP flow tag as
  one case-preserving URL-safe segment.
- Made diagnostic rendering total, bounded, accessor-free, and redacting so a
  hostile failure cannot replace the original cause.
- Scoped `layerMemory.poll` to the flow it is asked about. It ignored its flow
  argument and answered with another flow's `Flow.Result` under the caller's
  declared schemas; an execution belonging to a different declaration now
  answers `Option.none()`, matching the durable driver.
- Refused a reused execution id whose payload differs in the in-memory engine,
  so the memory and durable implementations of one `Encoded` seam agree on the
  same request.
- Clamped a persisted retry origin that sits ahead of the local clock. A skewed
  or corrupt origin made the first failed attempt give up as `expired` with the
  schedule-to-close budget unconsumed; the clamp is logged.
- Ignored an unusable `actionLatestAttempt` from a driver. A non-integer value
  flowed into the attempt identity and the backoff ladder; the engine now falls
  back to its own attempt and logs the rejected value.
- Refused an irreversible keyless action before sleeping its backoff instead of
  after it.
- Populated `Action.UncanonicalIdempotencyKey.path` with the offending path
  inside the declared identity. It was the constant `"$"` on every failure.
- Logged a defect from a body served over RPC. `layerRpcHandlers` logged
  nothing, while `layerHttpApi` logged and annotated every one.
- Derived `layerHttpApi`'s three operation names from
  `FlowProxy.operationAddresses`, the one helper every other proxy site
  already used.
- Documented the `Encoded` seam accurately. Only `actionExecute`,
  `deferredResult`, `deferredDone`, and `deferredDoneIfWaiting` carry encoded
  values; `execute` and `poll` return decoded results the implementation
  produced itself.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added the vendored durable flow engine with caller-selected execution
  identity, caller-computed action keys, explicit infrastructure-interrupt
  retry, durability tiers, snapshot boundaries, and signal-assisted resume.

### Fixed

- Kept coverage thresholds on the explicit coverage command so ordinary
  `vitest run` remains the package test gate.
