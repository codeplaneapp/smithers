/**
 * Buffered command execution over the permission-aware process spawner.
 *
 * Every command this package runs — `jj`, `git`, an install, a typecheck, a
 * test suite — goes through here, so the `proc:spawn` capability check and the
 * command-line resource stay exactly where the kernel put them. The buffered
 * shape is what a report wants: an exit code and two bounded tails, not a
 * stream nobody kept.
 *
 * Bounded while the command runs, not after it exits. Each stream is drained
 * through a rolling window that keeps the last {@link tailBytes} bytes and
 * counts what it dropped, so a test suite that prints a gigabyte costs this
 * process twelve kilobytes per stream, and a command that never stops
 * printing is stopped by its timeout rather than by the heap.
