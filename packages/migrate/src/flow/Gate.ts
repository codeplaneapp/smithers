/**
 * The two gates that stand between a scan and an edit.
 *
 * Neither gate is a judgement about the code. Both are decisions only a person
 * can make, and the tool refuses to make them silently:
 *
 * - **Run state.** A project that still holds 0.x run state cannot be
 *   migrated, because the 1.0 runtime can neither read nor resume it. That is
 *   true whether the runs are live, parked, or all finished, so `blocked` and
 *   `history-only` both refuse. `--acknowledge-run-state` is the operator
 *   saying what happens to it; the tool still never writes under any recorded
 *   path.
 * - **Unsafe constructs.** A construct with no counterpart has no honest
 *   automatic translation. `--allow-unsafe <construct,…>` is the operator
 *   accepting a `TODO(migrate-smithers-v1)` marker and a report entry in place
 *   of one.
 *
 * Both refusals exit 3 rather than 1: the project is intact, and there is a
 * decision to make rather than a failure to fix.
