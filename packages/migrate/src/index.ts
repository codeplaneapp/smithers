// The rest of the flow surface — `Checkpoint`, `Verify`, `Transform`,
// `Repair`, `Archive`, `MigrateFlow`, `Layers`, `Command`, and the
// `smithers-migrate` bin — is reached by subpath
// (`@smthrs/migrate/flow/Command`) rather than from this entry point, and the
// reason is a promise this package makes: `import "@smthrs/migrate"` loads the
// scanners and nothing else. A person deciding *whether* to migrate must not
// have to install the 1.0 runtime to find out, which is why every `@smthrs/*`
// dependency here is optional and why `test/flow/Dependencies.test.ts` pins
// the split.
