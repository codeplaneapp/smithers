/**
 * The coverage proof: the scanners run read only over a real, unsanitized 0.x
 * pack that nobody trimmed for them, and every name they find resolves to a
 * catalog row or is reported as one that does not.
 *
 * The pack is named by `SMITHERS_MIGRATE_PLUE_PACK`, the working tree of an
 * external project. The test never copies it, never writes to it, and skips
 * with a reason when the directory is not on this machine, so the suite stays
 * green on a checkout that has no such pack beside it. The variable is read
 * first so the case runs wherever the pack is kept, and the maintainer's own
 * path is the fallback rather than the contract.
 *
 * The scan runs once for the whole file. A pack this size is the tool's real
 * unit of work, not a per-assertion fixture.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
