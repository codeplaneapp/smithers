/**
 * The one import failure whose own message names the wrong problem.
 *
 * The 0.x requirements carried forward
 * (`packages/smithers/tests/bin-dangling-workspace-link-hint.test.js` and
 * `dangling-many-links.test.js`): a checkout whose `node_modules/@smthrs/*`
 * links point into a git worktree that has since been removed fails with
 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for a package that is present in the tree, and the
 * reader goes looking for a build problem that does not exist. The shim says
 * which links are broken, where they pointed, and what repairs them.
 *
 * The rest of the 0.x bin does not survive. `smithers-delegation.js` re-execed
 * into a nearest local `smthrs` install and parsed a JSX workflow path out of
 * argv; rc.0 publishes one package with one bin, takes no workflow-path
 * argument, and `bin/smithers.mjs` selects `dist` or `src` and nothing else.
