/**
 * The projection and reporting verbs, driven through the real parser.
 *
 * `CommandHandlers.test.ts` covers the listing and lifecycle spine. These are
 * the verbs on the other side of it: `output`, which answers what one step
 * produced; the `claude` mirror subcommands, which keep a per-session
 * subscription registry on disk; and `bug`, which posts a report over real
 * HTTP. Each has a projection module of its own with its own unit tests
 * (`NodeOutput`, `ClaudeMirror`, `Bug`), and each was wired into the command
 * tree without a case that drove the wiring: the argument decoding, the
 * `--json` versus rendered split, the refusals, and the services the handler
 * reaches for. That is what these cases pin.
 *
 * The HTTP endpoint is a real server on a real loopback port, not a stubbed
 * `fetch`: `bug` is a verb whose whole behaviour is what it does with a
 * response, and a double would assert the double.
