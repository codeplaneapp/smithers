/**
 * Control requests against runs this process does not own, and against runs
 * nobody owns any more.
 *
 * Three defects live here, and the first two are `interrupt` asking the wrong
 * question first.
 *
 * A terminal run has released its owner, so `ownedByUs` is false for every
 * process — including the one that ran it. Checking ownership before
 * terminality answered `ClaimLost` for a cancel of a completed run, which reads
 * as "somebody else has it" when the truth is "it already finished". `resume`
 * and `steer` both answer `Terminal` there; `cancel` has to as well, and it
 * must not journal a cancel request against a run that can never act on one
 * (triage B-12).
 *
 * A live run owned by another process is the other half. Cancellation is fiber
 * interruption and fibers are process-local, so the owning process is the only
 * one that can interrupt it — but the cancel still has to become durable, or a
 * second `flows` process, the UI, and a gateway can none of them stop a run.
 * The durable half is the engine row's `cancel_requested_at_ms`, written
 * through the `ControlExecutor.requestCancel` port, and the receipt for a
 * foreign live owner is `Accepted` rather than `ClaimLost` (triage B-10).
 *
 * The port write runs inside the control mutation's transaction, so a failure
 * rolls the whole cancel back: the control row never reaches `cancelled` while
 * the engine row is still running (triage B-11).
 *
 * Everything runs on the durable stack over real SQLite, because the claim
 * being tested is about two owners of one row and an in-memory double has one.
