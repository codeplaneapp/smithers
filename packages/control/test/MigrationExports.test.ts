// The CommonJS build converts every source module with esbuild's Node interop,
// where a default import of a sibling resolves to that module's whole exports
// object rather than the Effect it exported. Consumers therefore reach each
// migration through a named binding, and this suite pins both halves of that
// contract at the source so the published `require` entry keeps loading.
