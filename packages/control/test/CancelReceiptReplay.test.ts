/**
 * A cancel receipt is an answer about a run, not a receipt for having asked.
 *
 * `Control.cancel` keys its mutation on `cli:cancel:<runId>`, the key the CLI
 * passes, and `mutate` replays a recorded receipt for it forever. That is
 * right for a cancel that finished the run and wrong for one that did not: a
 * cancel against a run a live peer owns answers `Accepted` and leaves the run
 * running, and every later `smithers cancel` and `smithers down` then replayed
 * that `Accepted` as `AlreadyApplied` instead of asking again. The release validation
 * smoke left two runs permanently non-terminal that way — `gc` skips them, and
 * no CLI command could reach them.
 *
 * The shape here is the shipped one: two compositions over one control
 * database under two process identities, which is what a gateway and a CLI
 * are.
