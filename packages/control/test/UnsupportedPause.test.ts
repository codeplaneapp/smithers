/**
 * `pause` is gone from the control plane, and this is the gate that keeps it
 * gone.
 *
 * rc-contract §5.2 removes attributed pause from `1.0.0-rc.0` rather than
 * shipping it half-working: `SqlControlRuntime.pause` flipped the control row
 * to `parked` and released ownership, but it interrupted no fiber and parked no
 * engine run, so the body kept executing until its next fenced write failed.
 * PLAN.md Phase 5 forbids exactly that appearance, and the ruling was removal
 * rather than an `Unavailable` stub because the consumer inventory found no
 * caller.
 *
 * A removal is only real while nothing puts it back, so the assertions here are
 * negative on purpose: the verb is absent from the RPC group, from the `Control`
 * vtable every transport projects, from both `ControlRuntime` implementations,
 * and from the package's own source. The source scan is the one that catches a
 * re-introduction through a new file, which a type check would happily accept.
 *
 * The prose scan is the same guard one layer out. `docs/pages/api/control.md`
 * carried a `Control.pause` sentence for the whole of Phase 5 while the member
 * was already gone, and the generated `llms` bundles copied it four more times,
 * so a reader learned a verb the binary refuses. The page is generated from
 * this package, which makes this package the right place to prove it stayed
 * clean.
