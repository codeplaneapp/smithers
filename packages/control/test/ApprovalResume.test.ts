/**
 * A node approval has to restart the run it parked, and reach the process that
 * can restart it.
 *
 * `ask` parks the run as `waiting-approval` and publishes the exact payload an
 * operator replays through `smithers approve`. Answering it installed the grant
 * and resolved the token — and stopped there, so the run sat in
 * `waiting-approval` until somebody made a SECOND call, which rc-contract §5.1
 * and §10 promise a gateway client does not have to make (triage B-15).
 *
 * The first repair claimed the row and journaled `control.run.resumed`, and
 * both halves of that were wrong. The journal entry's only consumer is an
 * in-process `PubSub` no other journal instance can publish into, so a decision
 * taken anywhere else reached nobody. And `scope: "launched"` is not a process
 * scope — it is a `control_runs` lookup, a durable table every process over one
 * control database shares — so the deciding process took the row from the host
 * that could still drive it.
 *
 * What a decision does now is RECORD the restart. The delegation is durable,
 * `RunSummary.pendingResume` projects it, and the executor hosting the run
 * takes it up and clears it. A composition that hosts the run takes it up in
 * the deciding call itself; one that does not leaves it standing.
 *
 * A denial is the same shape. The ask activity reads its decision from the
 * grant store, and it only reads it when the execution is re-driven, so a
 * denied run that is never resumed never learns it was denied.
