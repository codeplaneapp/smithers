/**
 * Run ancestry as the control plane reads it.
 *
 * A run's ancestry is recorded by whoever created the run, in four different
 * places: the run row's `parent_run_id`, `lineage_id`, and `round_ordinal`
 * columns; the `flows_run_parents` edge a spawn writes; the `created` and
 * `handed-off` run decisions the engine journals; and the `fork-created`
 * marker time travel writes on a forked child. This module owns the one
 * vocabulary they all project onto — {@link Origin} — and the pure functions
 * that do the projecting, so the durable runtime and the watch stream cannot
 * disagree about what a run's ancestry means.
 *
 * The two event types named here are produced by `@smthrs/engine-store` and
 * `@smthrs/time-travel`. They are named as strings rather than imported
 * because the control plane reads journals, not engines: a control plane that
 * depended on the engine could not project a journal written by a different
 * one.

 * truncates a run in place and creates none — and a run with no ancestor has

/**
 * Derives the ancestry edge one journal entry discloses, if it discloses one.
 *
 * Three entries do, and each names a different pair:
 *
 * | Entry | Ancestor | Descendant |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `created` naming `parentExecutionId`, at round 0 or with no round | the spawning run | the entry's run |
 * | `handed-off` naming `nextExecutionId` | the entry's run | the next round |
 * | `fork-created` | the forked-from run | the entry's run |
 *
 * The handoff is what carries a trampoline, and a continuation round's own
 * `created` decision is deliberately skipped. The engine journals BOTH in one
 * transaction: `RunDriver` creates the next round with
 * `{decision: "created", lineageId, roundOrdinal, parentExecutionId}` and then
 * records `{decision: "handed-off", nextExecutionId}` on the round that
 * finished. Both name the same pair, so deriving from both would report one
 * run as a `child` of its predecessor on one entry and a `continuation` of it
 * on the other. The handoff is the one kept, because it reaches a consumer
 * watching the run that hands off — which is the run an operator is already
 * following when a trampoline advances.
 *
 * A `created` decision at round 0, or with no round at all, is an ordinary
 * spawn and derives a `child` edge.
 *
 * Everything else derives nothing. This is a projection over entries the
 * control plane did not write, so an entry it does not recognize is not an
 * error.
