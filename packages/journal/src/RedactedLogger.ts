/**
 * The redacting logger: the journal's redaction rules applied to log output.
 *
 * The journal redacts on the write path, so a credential a cell logs or
 * returns never reaches a committed row (`./Redaction.ts`). The operator's
 * terminal was the other place the same credential surfaces: every built-in
 * Effect logger renders through the fiber's `Console`, so an action that hands
 * a token to `Effect.logInfo` wrote it to stderr in full and it reached
 * whatever collected that stream.
 *
 * This module closes that half with the SAME rules rather than a second rule
 * set. {@link wrap} does not re-implement redaction and does not re-format a
 * log line. It redacts the log event itself — the message, the cause, and the
 * log annotations — before the wrapped logger is handed it, and it hands that
 * logger a view of the fiber whose `Console` is a redacting console, so
 * whatever the logger renders for itself — a pretty line, a JSON document —
 * passes through `Redaction.redact` on its way to the stream as well.
 *
 * Both halves carry load. Most built-in loggers write through the fiber's
 * `Console`, which is what covers the pretty line, the `--json` document, and
 * the `.flows/logs/<runId>.log` stream. But a logger is free to read the event
 * instead of rendering it, and one in Effect's own default logger set does:
 * `Logger.tracerLogger` publishes the message as a span event name and
 * `Cause.pretty` of the cause as the span's `effect.cause` attribute, and
 * never reads `Console` at all. Redacting only the console would hide a
 * credential on stderr and export it in clear to whatever OTLP collector is
 * configured (`examples/src/10-telemetry-export.ts`, `docs/pages/telemetry.md`).
 *
 * Cost is bounded by the rules themselves: `Redaction.defaultRules` are three
 * unanchored character-class scans with no nested quantifier and no
 * alternation inside a repetition, so each one is linear in the length of the
 * line and no input backtracks catastrophically.
 *
 * One deliberate difference from the journal write path. `Redaction.redact`
 * rebuilds an object from its own enumerable entries, which is right for a row
 * that is about to be JSON-encoded and wrong for a terminal: an `Error` keeps
 * `message` and `stack` on non-enumerable properties, so rebuilding one prints
 * `{}` where the operator expected a failure. An `Error` is rebuilt as a plain
 * `Error` instead, carrying its name, message, stack and own members with the
 * rules applied. Its class is NOT preserved. A copy built on the original's
 * prototype inherits everything the prototype defines, an own-key walk sees
 * none of it, and each of `name`, `cause`, `toJSON`, `Symbol.toStringTag` and
 * `nodejs.util.inspect.custom` carried a credential out that way.
