/**
 * The package's central architectural rule, stated in README.md and
 * src/README.md: heavy third-party renderers live under `adapters/` behind
 * their own package subpath and never weigh down the base barrel.
 *
 * Nothing enforced it. `scripts/check-ui-architecture.mjs`, the script both
 * READMEs named, was deleted in the 1.0 migration (package inventory row
 * `scripts/check-ui-architecture.mjs`, since deleted), and by the time
 * this ratchet was written `export * from "./vault"` was pulling `d3-force`
 * into `@smthrs/ui` through `KnowledgeGraph`.
 *
 * This is the replacement, and it measures the thing the rule is about: what a
 * bundler actually emits for a consumer. The build is deliberately
 * non-splitting, which is the mode this package is consumed in.

/**
 * Bundle a module the way a consumer reaches it: through an entry that imports
 * the namespace and retains it.
 *
 * Handing the bundler a re-export-only barrel directly is not a measurement.
 * It emits the export list with no bodies at all (7 KB, zero functions),
 * because nothing in the graph is retained, so every "is X absent" assertion
 * would pass against an empty bundle. A consuming entry is the honest shape:
 * this one builds to about 1 MB with ~900 functions.
 *
 * The bundle runs in a FRESH bun process, never through in-process `Bun.build`.
 *
 * Bun's bundler shares its file cache with the test runner's module registry:
 * once any suite has imported these modules at runtime — `barrel-reachability.test.ts`
 * imports the whole barrel, and `bun test` runs all 105 files in one process —
 * a later in-process `Bun.build` reads crossed content and drops modules it
 * cannot parse ("Unexpected reading file" for react, "EISDIR" for clsx, a
 * `./types` import reported at `react/index.js:7`). The knowledge-graph
 * control then measured a bundle that never had d3-force in it: green when
 * this file ran alone, red under `bun test tests` on CI (run 33656132180).
 * Bun 1.3.14 and 1.4.0 both do it, Linux and macOS alike.
 *
 * A subprocess is also the honest shape: a consumer's bundle is a build, not
 * a call inside a test runner that already loaded half the graph.
