/**
 * The name every provider derives a machine's identity from.
 *
 * `sessionSlug` is not an implementation detail. Its output is the container
 * name, the Pod name, the Vercel and Daytona sandbox names, the Cloudflare
 * Durable Object id, the ECS `startedBy` tag, and the `DirectorySandbox`
 * scratch directory, and every reattach path finds an existing machine by that
 * name. Changing the function orphans everything currently running under the
 * old names, so the exact values are pinned here rather than recomputed by
 * calling the function under test, which would pass for any implementation.
