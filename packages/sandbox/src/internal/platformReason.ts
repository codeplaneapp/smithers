 *
 * It lives here rather than in each adapter because two copies of the same
 * table under the same comment drifted: a caller holding a normalized
 * `PlatformError` could not infer the provider code without also knowing which
 * adapter had produced it.
 *
 * `unavailable` and `not_found` share `NotFound` deliberately at the process
 * seam. `not_found` exists so "absent" and "broken" stay apart in the PROVIDER
 * vocabulary, and they do; what they mean to a caller of a spawner is the same
 * instruction — this session cannot run your command, try somewhere else —
 * which is the reason `SandboxSupervision.retired` reports a retired session
 * as `NotFound` too. A caller that needs the distinction reads
 * `PlatformError.cause`, which carries the `ProviderError` itself.
