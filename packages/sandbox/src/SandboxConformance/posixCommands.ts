 *
 * The session contract already pins command lines to POSIX `sh` semantics, so
 * unlike the spawner-level suite, this one can supply its own fixture; a
 * session whose machine speaks something else overrides it.
 *
 * `runs` sleeps for a duration nothing else on a shared machine is likely to
 * be sleeping for, and `survivor` looks for exactly that sleep with a pattern
 * that cannot match its own command line. A guest without `pgrep` answers 127
 * and the survivor question goes unanswered rather than wrongly answered.
 *
 * `check` does not use this value verbatim: several providers' machines are
 * the test host itself, and vitest runs suites in parallel workers, so two
 * checks sharing one duration would each find the other's fixture alive and
 * report a survivor that is not theirs. The default each check actually runs
 * is {@link uniquePosixCommands}, which keeps this shape and makes the
 * duration this process's own.
