/**
 * @since 0.1.0
 *
 * `@smthrs/sandbox` — provisioned machines, remote process execution, and
 * sandbox liveness.
 *
 * Modules are re-exported as namespaces, the way `effect`'s own index does it,
 * so each keeps its `make` / `makeNoop` / `layerNoop` trio without colliding
 * with its neighbour.
 *
 * The package is **platform-neutral and browser-bundleable**: it adapts a
 * provider a caller hands it onto Effect's `ChildProcessSpawner` contract and
 * owns no host access of its own. `scripts/browser-check.mjs` at the repository
 * root pins that property. Every provider below obeys it the same way — a
 * vendor SDK arrives as an injected structural slice and a CLI arrives as an
 * injected spawner, so adding a backend costs this package no dependency and
 * no host access.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { ContainerSandbox, Sandbox } from "@smthrs/sandbox"
 * ```
