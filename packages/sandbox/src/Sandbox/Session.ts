/**
 * One provisioned machine, held for the scope that acquired it.
 *
 * A session is what `RemoteChildProcessSpawner.Provider` is not: a machine
 * with a filesystem. The spawner-level provider carries commands to a remote
 * side and nothing else, which is the right contract for a transport but not
 * enough to *place* work — a body that edits a file and then compiles it needs
 * the file operations and the processes to see the same tree. A session
 * therefore adds byte-typed file transfer to the same spawn the narrower
 * contract has, and every richer surface (an Effect `FileSystem`, a host
 * bundle, workspace seeding) is derived from these operations rather than
 * asked of the adapter.
 *
 * The contract's obligations, which `SandboxConformance` states as behavior:
 *
 * - `spawn` without a `cwd` runs in {@link Session.workdir}.
 * - `writeFile` creates missing parent directories.
 * - `readFile` of an absent path fails with code `not_found`, so a caller can
 *   tell "nothing there" from "session broken".
 * - File contents are bytes and survive a round-trip unchanged. An adapter
 *   whose SDK speaks text encodes; the seam does not.
 *
 * `kill` and `ping` mean what they mean on the spawner-level provider, and are
 * optional for the same reason. `files` is an adapter's escape hatch: any
 * Effect `FileSystem` operation it can serve natively (a local directory
 * serving real `stat`, an SDK with its own listing call) overrides the
 * portable probe `fileSystem` would otherwise derive from `spawn`.
