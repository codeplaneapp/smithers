/**
 * What the guarded-spawn gate can and cannot see.
 *
 * The gate's whole subject is the bypass nobody has written yet, which makes
 * it the one check in this repository that the tree cannot exercise: nothing
 * under `packages/*\/src` spells most of these forms today, so a reader that
 * missed one would look exactly like a reader that works, right up to the day
 * someone writes it. Three regex versions of the reader shipped looking
 * exactly like that, and each was one layout wide.
 *
 * So every layout is a FIXTURE FILE, written to a temporary directory and read
 * back through the same walk-and-parse path the real scan uses. The files are
 * written rather than committed on purpose: `dprint` formats everything in
 * this repository, including tests, and the formatter is what produced the
 * bypass in the first place. A committed multi-line fixture short enough to
 * fit on one line would be collapsed to one line by the next `dprint fmt`, and
 * the layout it exists to pin would silently stop being tested.
 *
 * `legacyRegex` below is the reader as it stood at `5370016971`, kept so the
 * gap is stated as a fact rather than as history: it names, executably, every
 * layout that shipped unguarded.
