/**
 * The chat flow: a question in, an answer plus cards out.
 *
 * The file's location is its name. `flows/chat/flow.ts` is the flow `chat`, its
 * seat and teaching come from the nearest ancestor AGENT.ts, and its tools come
 * from the nearest ancestor TOOLS.ts. Nothing here names a model.
 *
 * `chat: true` is routing metadata: it tells a host to offer this flow on its
 * turn endpoint rather than its flow-run endpoint. It does not carry a
 * conversation across turns by itself. Each turn opens its own execution from
 * its own payload, so a host that wants continuity replays the history it kept
 * into the next turn's payload.
