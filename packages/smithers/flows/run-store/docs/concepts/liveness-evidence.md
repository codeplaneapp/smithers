An expired lease says the owner stopped writing. It does not say the owner
stopped working. Evidence is the second lever: a claim about the recorded owner
that the store can check before it admits a takeover.

## Three kinds, three scopes

`Ownership.LivenessEvidence` carries the owner it is about, the instant it was
observed, and what kind of claim it is:

```ts
import type { LivenessEvidence } from "@smthrs/run-store/Ownership"

const evidence: LivenessEvidence = {
  expectedOwner: { hostId: "host-a", pid: 4102, nonce: "3f9c" },
  checkedAtMs: 1757000030000,
  kind: "same-host-pid-dead"
}
```

Each kind is admitted only where it means something:

- **`same-host-pid-dead`** is a local process probe. A pid names a process only
  inside one process namespace, so the store accepts this kind only when the
  observer and the recorded owner share a `hostId`.
- **`cross-host-unreachable-stale`** is a reachability judgment the deployment
  makes. It is accepted only when the hosts differ: on the owner's own host it
  would be an unprobed guess dressed as evidence.
- **`lease-expired`** asserts only that the persisted heartbeat is older than
  the staleness cutoff. That is the one claim the store can verify for itself,
  and `steal` does verify it: the write refuses any row whose `heartbeat_at_ms`
  is still inside the window. It is therefore accepted from any host.

Two of the three are collected outside this package, because the store never
probes a process or a network itself. It validates what it is handed.

## Evidence binds to one instant

`evidence.checkedAtMs` must equal the `nowMs` of the call that consumes it,
exactly. A probe taken at T is refused by a call made at T plus one
millisecond, and the caller has to build fresh evidence.

That rule is what stops a probe from being replayed. Without it, a caller could
hold one "the owner is dead" observation and spend it against a run whose owner
came back. `claimAndOwn`, `recoverClaim`, and `steal` all enforce it.

`steal` also separates two refusals that look alike from outside.
`LivenessUnconfirmed` means the evidence did not match the snapshot's owner,
the host relation its `kind` requires, or `nowMs`, so no compare-and-swap ran
at all. `SnapshotChanged` is reserved for matching evidence whose comparison
lost to a row that moved. A caller can tell "I was not allowed to try" from "I
tried and lost".

## A check answers, a probe produces

Two types sit either side of the store, and they answer different questions.

**`LivenessCheck`** is the question the arbitration asks before it decides to
steal: is the recorded owner still working? It takes the owner and a
`LivenessContext` carrying the claimant, the persisted `heartbeatAtMs`, and the
`nowMs` the decision is made against, and answers a boolean. Answering `true`
refuses the takeover. The engine consults it only for a run whose lease has
already expired.

**`LivenessProbe`** is the evidence factory: given the expected owner, the
claimant, and the instant, it produces `LivenessEvidence` or `undefined` for
`steal`, `claimAndOwn`, and `recoverClaim` to verify.

The package ships two checks.

`Ownership.leaseLiveness(staleAfter?)` is the default and the honest floor: an
owner is alive for as long as its persisted heartbeat is younger than the
cutoff, and gone once it is not. It is the weakest answer, and the one every
host can give. A fresh process with no application code at all can reclaim a
hard-killed owner's runs once the lease it stopped renewing expires. Browser
compositions keep it, because a tab has no process table to ask.

`Ownership.sameHostPidProbe` asks the operating system instead:

```ts
import type * as NodeRuntime from "@smthrs/flows/NodeRuntime"
import { Ownership } from "@smthrs/run-store"

const options: NodeRuntime.Options = {
  filename: ".smithers/smithers.db",
  workspaceRoot: "/srv/workspace",
  owner: { hostId: "host-a" },
  isAlive: Ownership.sameHostPidProbe
}
```

It exists because the lease alone is only a timeout: two engine processes over
one database steal each other's running rows `heartbeatStaleAfter` after any
heartbeat stall, whether that stall was a dead process, a stop-the-world pause,
or a disk that blocked too long. The probe answers the question the lease is
standing in for.

## Every unknown answer is life

`sameHostPidProbe` sends no signal. `process.kill(pid, 0)` performs only the
delivery checks, and exactly three answers matter:

- It returns: the process exists. The owner is alive.
- It throws `ESRCH`: no such process. This is the sole death answer.
- It throws anything else, including `EPERM` and `EINVAL`, or the pid is not a
  positive safe integer: the owner is treated as alive, because an unknown
  answer is not death.

Failing closed is the whole point. A check that returns `false` without asking
says "that owner is gone" about an owner it never looked at, and the engine
steals runs out of live processes on the strength of it. That is why
`@smthrs/flows/NodeRuntime` requires `isAlive` rather than defaulting it.

Two limits are inherent to asking a pid, and they bound what reclaim can
promise:

- **An owner recorded with the claimant's own pid is always alive.** A previous
  incarnation of this process, or a second engine composed inside it, differs
  from the claimant only by `nonce`, and the process it names is this one. Such
  a row is never stolen while the process lives, so an embedded host that
  re-creates its engine in place should keep `leaseLiveness`, whose timeout does
  expire.
- **A reused pid reports the unrelated process that now holds it.** The dead
  owner's row stays refused for as long as that process lives, which delays
  reclaim rather than breaking it: the row is still `running` under an expired
  lease, and the next probe after the pid is free reclaims it.

A recorded owner on another host is never probed. The answer is `false`, which
adds no evidence and lets the expired lease decide, so a host that dies for
good does not strand its runs where no other machine could ever produce
evidence about its pids.
