/**
 * `@smthrs/capability` is the leaf vocabulary of the Smithers permission
 * kernel. It holds the words, never the enforcement.
 *
 * Capability values and permission failures live here, apart from the kernel
 * that enforces them, so a protected Host service can declare the failures its
 * guarded interface adds without depending on `@smthrs/kernel`.
 *
 * The package owns the exact `Capability`, its wildcard `CapabilityPattern`
 * and glob grammar, the `action:resource` text form both render into and parse
 * back from, the effect tier a write is classified into, the ordered policy
 * rules a decision reduces, and the three typed failures a guarded Host call
 * can add.
