/**
 * A flow execution has no selected identity.
 *
 * The opt-in `derived` execution-id source raises this when the payload
 * cannot be canonicalized, for example a non-finite number, a lone surrogate,
 * or a cycle. It dies with it before starting a run, so this is a defect and
 * not a typed failure a body catches. The default `fresh` source instead
 * mints a cryptographic UUID for every unkeyed invocation.
 *
 * A served resume raises it too: `FlowProxyServer` dies with it when the
 * `ExecutionIdScope` configured on a layer returns `undefined` for a resume
 * request, because the client value is not a fallback there.
