/**
 * A name fragment for a session key: the key's leading safe characters, for
 * the operator reading a process or container list, plus a 64-bit digest of
 * the WHOLE key, so `a/b` and `a-b` cannot share a machine and neither can two
 * keys that merely start alike.
 *
 * The digest is two independent multiplicative hashes concatenated, not one.
 * A single 32-bit djb2 is not enough here, and not for the birthday reason: its
 * tail is linear, so two keys sharing the truncated prefix collide as soon as
 * their remaining characters satisfy one modular sum (`"a".repeat(48) + "1r"`
 * and `"a".repeat(48) + "30"` both reduce to the same value, because
 * `33 * c1 + c2` is 1731 for each). FNV-1a mixes by XOR before a different
 * prime, so a collision has to satisfy both halves at once. That is a bound,
 * not a proof: this is a checksum, not a cryptographic digest, and the honest
 * claim is 64 bits over the whole key rather than "collision-proof".
 *
 * The slug is durable machine identity — every provider's container name, Pod
 * name, sandbox name, Durable Object id, ECS `startedBy` tag, and scratch
 * directory is derived from it — so changing this function orphans anything
 * currently running under the old names. `test/SessionSlug.test.ts` pins the
 * exact output for that reason.
