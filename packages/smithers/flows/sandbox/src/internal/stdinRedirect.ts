/**
 * Builds a per-session redirect: hands back a function that stages a
 * command's standard input as a file and rewrites the command to read from
 * it.
 *
 * Most vendor execution APIs take a command line and nothing else, so the
 * only way to satisfy the session contract's "spawn delivers stdin" is to put
 * the bytes where the command can reach them: a file in the workspace, read
 * through an ordinary redirection.
 *
 * The file's lifetime is the spawn's scope, not the command's own good
 * behavior. Removal used to be a `rm` appended to the rewritten command line,
 * which is exactly the cleanup a kill or an interruption skips: the wrapper
 * shell died with the command and the bytes stayed on the machine. It is a
 * scoped resource instead, so removal is attempted on success, failure, kill, and
 * interruption alike.
 *
 * The removal is registered BEFORE the first byte is written, not around the
 * write. `Effect.acquireRelease` registers its release only once its acquire
 * has succeeded, and no bundled provider writes a file atomically:
 * `AwsSandbox` sends one `printf | base64 -d` per `ExecTransport.chunkBytes`
 * bytes over a separate remote round trip and stops at the first non-zero
 * status. A write that dropped partway through therefore left the chunks it
 * had already delivered on the machine with nothing registered to take them
 * away, for the life of the machine and across a reattach.
 *
 * What the staging guarantees is an unguessable name inside the workspace and
 * a removal attempt on scope closure, bounded to five seconds and warned on
 * failure. It does not set a mode or an owner on the directory: the session's
 * own writeFile is the only channel a provider
 * hands this module, so the file is created under the machine's umask like
 * every other file the session writes.
 *
 * The command text is placed verbatim on separate lines inside a subshell,
 * redirected from the staged file. This keeps its exit status and quoting,
 * and lets trailing comments and heredoc terminators end before the closing
 * parenthesis.
