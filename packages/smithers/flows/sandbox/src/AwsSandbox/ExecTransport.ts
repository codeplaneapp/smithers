/**
 * The AWS CLI and its Session Manager plugin, over an injected spawner.
 *
 * ECS Exec is two halves. `ExecuteCommand` on the ECS API opens an SSM session
 * and returns its metadata, and that is all `@aws-sdk/client-ecs` implements.
 * The data channel that carries the command's output and exit status is the
 * Session Manager protocol, which the AWS CLI speaks by delegating to
 * `session-manager-plugin`. A session therefore runs commands the way an
 * operator does at a terminal: `aws ecs execute-command --interactive`, driven
 * through the spawner a host injects, so the package still owns no host access
 * and no dependency.
 *
 * Two consequences of that transport are visible to callers and stated here
 * rather than hidden. The session is a pseudo-terminal, so a command's
 * standard error arrives interleaved on standard output and line endings are
 * normalized; file transfer is byte-exact when the streaming adapter is
 * supplied, because it travels as base64. And the plugin exits zero whatever the remote command did, so the
 * provider wraps every command to print its own exit status and reads that
 * back; a session that ends without it is reported as `aborted`, never as
 * success.
 *
 * What this repository can and cannot prove about it: the framing, the
 * sentinel, the byte paths, and the signal walk are exercised against a fake
 * that reproduces the plugin's banner, footer, carriage returns, and zero exit
 * over a real shell. That the ECS agent hands `--command` to the container's
 * `sh` (which is why the provider sends `sh -c '...'`) is taken from the
 * service's documented behavior, not from a live cluster run here. Sensitive input requires the
 * separate streaming adapter below; it never rides inside `--command`.
