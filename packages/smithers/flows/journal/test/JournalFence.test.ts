/**
 * The journal's durable channel accepts an `OwnerId` and fences the append on
 * it: the INSERT only lands while `flows_runs` still records that owner as the
 * running run's owner, and otherwise the append fails `fence_lost` rather than
 * writing behind a live successor.
 *
 * `flows_runs` belongs to `@smthrs/run-store`, which depends on this package
 * and so cannot be depended on from here. This suite therefore stands up the
 * *columns the fence reads* as a fixture, which is exactly the contract the
 * journal asserts on a table it does not own. `@smthrs/engine-store` — which
 * composes both — pins the same behaviour against the real migrated schema in
 * its `JournalFencing` suite.
