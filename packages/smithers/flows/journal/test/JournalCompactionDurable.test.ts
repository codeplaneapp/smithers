/**
 * The reader/compactor race against a real file-backed SQLite database, with
 * the reader and the compactor on separate connections.
 *
 * `JournalCompaction.test.ts` runs the same race through an in-memory database
 * and an SQL proxy, where the "concurrent" compaction is really the same
 * connection reentered. The ordering `readPage` relies on — read the page, then
 * read the compaction floor, so any truncation that could have shortened the
 * page is visible in the floor — is a claim about two *transactions*, and only
 * a second connection to a real file can put a committed DELETE between them.
 *
 * The contract: a paged read is either a complete history or a typed
 * `compacted` carrying the resync point. A silently shortened or gapped page is
 * the one outcome that must be impossible, because a caller cannot tell it from
 * a genuine end of history.
 *
 * Child processes are not available to this package's tooling, so the compactor
 * is a second `NodeDatabase` connection in this process. The SQLite transaction
 * boundary it commits across is the same one a second process would cross.
