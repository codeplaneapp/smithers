Compaction drops the entries a run no longer needs to replay. It is off by
default, so nothing here happens unless you ask for it.

Every step is fenced: `checkpoint` and `compact` both take an `OwnerId` and
both need a `flows_runs` row from [`@smthrs/run-store`](/api/run-store). See
[Installation](../installation.md#what-a-fenced-write-needs).

## Checkpoint the replay state

Capture whatever your reader needs to resume, and pin it to a committed
sequence:

```ts
import { Journal } from "@smthrs/journal"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const checkpointTail = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const journal = yield* Journal.Journal

  const page = yield* journal.entries({ runId, limit: 1000 })
  const tip = page.entries.at(-1)
  if (tip === undefined) return

  yield* journal.checkpoint({ runId, seq: tip.seq, state: { started: 3, finished: 2 } }, owner)
})
```

`state` round-trips verbatim; the journal never interprets it and never redacts
it. A value that must not persist belongs in a `Redacted` field of your own
state schema.

The sequence must name a committed entry and must lie above the run's current
floor, or the write fails `checkpoint_invalid`. Re-checkpointing an uncompacted
sequence replaces its state.

## Truncate below it

```ts
const truncate = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const journal = yield* Journal.Journal
  const compacted = yield* journal.compact({ runId }, owner)
  console.log(compacted.deleted, "entries removed below", compacted.checkpointSeq)
})
```

Omit `upTo` to compact to the run's latest checkpoint, or pass a specific
sequence. The deletion and the floor advance commit atomically. The checkpointed
entry itself survives: it holds the run's allocation floor, so a restarted
process can never re-allocate a truncated sequence.

A retried compaction returns `deleted: 0` rather than failing.

## Handle a refusal

`compact` refuses in three typed ways, and each asks for something different:

- `checkpoint_invalid`: the run has no checkpoint to truncate below, or none at
  the sequence you named. Write one first.
- `reader_behind`: a live in-process `stream` still needs a sequence the
  truncation would delete. `checkpointSeq` carries the checkpoint it declined
  to truncate below. Wait for the reader, or drop it.
- `fence_lost`: another process owns the run. Stop; a zombie owner must not
  truncate history behind a live successor.

## Resync a reader

A reader whose cursor is below the floor fails with `compacted`, carrying the
floor in `checkpointSeq`. Recovery is the checkpoint plus the tail after it:

```ts
import * as Option from "effect/Option"
import * as Stream from "effect/Stream"

const resync = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const journal = yield* Journal.Journal
  return yield* journal.stream({ runId }).pipe(
    Stream.catchTag("@smthrs/journal/JournalError", (failure) =>
      failure.code === "compacted"
        ? Stream.unwrap(Effect.gen(function*() {
          const checkpoint = yield* journal.latestCheckpoint(runId)
          if (Option.isNone(checkpoint)) return Stream.fail(failure)
          return journal.stream({ runId, afterSequence: checkpoint.value.seq })
        }))
        : Stream.fail(failure)),
    Stream.take(100),
    Stream.runCollect
  )
})
```

`latestCheckpoint` returns the run's most recent checkpoint whether or not it
has been compacted, so the same call serves both cases.

## Hand it to the policy

Set `compaction` on the layer to make this automatic:

```ts
import { SqlJournal } from "@smthrs/journal"

const layer = SqlJournal.layer({
  capacity: 1024,
  overflow: "reject",
  compaction: {
    entryThreshold: 5_000,
    capture: (runId, upTo) => captureReplayState(runId, upTo)
  }
})
```

Once a run's committed entry count reaches `entryThreshold`, the journal
captures your replay state at the run's durable tail, checkpoints it, and
compacts below it. The policy holds no fence, so it needs no owner and no
`flows_runs` row.

Write `capture` to finish quickly and to tolerate being abandoned: it is
interrupted after 30 seconds, and a failed or refused attempt is logged at
warning, damped for `entryThreshold` further entries, and never surfaced to the
emit that triggered it.

  these calls.

  meets the floor.
