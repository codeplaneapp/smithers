/**
 * A retry policy landing on a fresh sandbox session.
 *
 * `SandboxSupervision` exists to turn a dead remote session into a failure the
 * retry policy can act on, and then to give the retry somewhere to land. The
 * sandbox package proves the supervision half against `Effect.retry`, which is
 * a different mechanism from the one the claim is about: a flows `RetryPolicy`
 * is the engine's retry, with its own attempt accounting, and an action that
 * fails inside a retired session has to come back on a session the provider
 * opened after the retirement.
 *
 * This is the only package that can state it, because it is the only one that
 * has both the engine and the sandbox.
