/**
 * Whether a source file BINDS a module that can start a process.
 *
 * Containment is a property of the `ChildProcessSpawner` service: a host
 * decorates it once (`ContainedSpawner` adds `forceKillAfter ?? graceMs` and a
 * `ProcessLedger` record) and every module that resolves the tag inherits the
 * kill deadline and the journal entry. A module that reaches for
 * `node:child_process` directly inherits neither, and no behavioral test can
 * see that: the module works, its suite is green, and the only symptom is a
 * process still running on someone's machine after the flow that started it
 * was cancelled. So the bypass is checked for by reading source.
 *
 * This module is the reader. Two suites use it —
 * `packages/smithers/agent/std/test/ExecContainment.test.ts` over `packages/smithers/agent/std/src` alone,
 * where it fails fast during work on that package, and
 * `scripts/test/spawnContainment.test.ts` over every package — and
 * they share one implementation so the tree-wide gate can never be narrower
 * than the package-local one.
 *
 * It reads the TypeScript SYNTAX TREE rather than the text, because three
 * regex versions of this gate were each one layout wide. The last one matched
 * `^\s*import\s[^\n]*?from\s*"node:child_process"`, which the repository's own
 * formatter walks straight through: `dprint` breaks any import over 120
 * characters into `import {` … `} from "node:child_process"`, and a
 * single-line pattern cannot cross that break. Stripping comments first and
 * matching on position instead is no better, because a `//` inside a string
 * literal then eats the rest of the line. A parser has no such edge: an import
 * is an import in every layout, and a comment is not a node at all.

/**
 * The modules whose import is the thing being gated, in every spelling that

 * The `node:` prefix is optional because omitting it binds exactly the same
 * module, and nothing in this repository requires the prefix: no
 * `packages/*\/eslint.config.js` configures `unicorn/prefer-node-protocol` or
 * `no-restricted-imports`. A gate that matched only the prefixed spelling
 * would be one token wide.
 *
 * `cluster` is here beside `child_process` because `cluster.fork()` starts a
 * process the same way and inherits the same nothing. Threads are out of
 * scope: a `node:worker_threads` worker dies with the process that made it.

/**
 * Whether this source binds a process-starting module, in any layout.
 *
 * Every form the language offers is one of four node shapes:
 *
 *  - `ImportDeclaration` and `ExportDeclaration` cover `import x from`,
 *    `import type`, `import * as`, the side-effect `import "…"` with no
 *    clause at all, `export { … } from`, and `export * from`, each over any
 *    number of lines and with an import-attributes clause or without one;
 *  - `ImportEqualsDeclaration` covers `import x = require("…")`;
 *  - `ImportTypeNode` covers `typeof import("…")` in type position;
 *  - a call or `new` whose FIRST ARGUMENT is the specifier covers `import()`,
 *    `require()`, `createRequire(import.meta.url)("…")`,
 *    `process.getBuiltinModule("…")`, and any loader helper written next year.
 *    The callee is deliberately not checked: passing one of these specifiers
 *    as the first argument of anything is the bypass, whatever the helper is
 *    called.
 *
 * Prose is not matched, and needs no rule to keep it unmatched: a comment is
 * trivia, not a node, so a module that quotes the very import line it is
 * warning against is clean. A specifier sitting in a plain string is not
 * matched either, because a string that is not an argument binds nothing.
 *
 * @param source The file's text.
 * @param path Used only to choose the parser's script kind; it need not exist.
