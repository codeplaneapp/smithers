`CacheStore.layer` requires two services and one precondition: Effect's
`SqlClient`, the `DurableWriter` write boundary from
[`@smthrs/database`](/api/database), and the two tables already created. This
guide composes all three.

## Build the database pair

`NodeDatabase.layer` provides the SQL client and nothing else.
`DurableWriter.layer` adds the write policy above it, and it accepts any Effect
`SqlClient`, so the retry classification is the same whichever driver you
compose:

```ts
import * as DurableWriter from "@smthrs/database/DurableWriter"
import * as NodeDatabase from "@smthrs/database/node/NodeDatabase"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

const database = Layer.provideMerge(
  DurableWriter.layer(),
  NodeDatabase.layer({ filename: "flows.sqlite" })
)
```

## Run the migrations beneath the store

`Migrations.layer` creates `flows_step_cache` and
`flows_step_cache_recorded`. Compose it under the store so the tables exist
before the service is exposed:

```ts
import * as CacheStore from "@smthrs/step-cache/CacheStore"
import * as Migrations from "@smthrs/step-cache/Migrations"

const cache = CacheStore.layer.pipe(
  Layer.provide(Layer.provideMerge(Migrations.layer, database))
)
```

`Layer.provideMerge` keeps the database services in the output of the inner
layer so `CacheStore.layer` can reach them; `Layer.provide` hides them again
above the store, leaving `Layer<CacheStore.CacheStore>`. Use `Layer.provideMerge`
for the outer composition too if the rest of your program also needs the SQL
client.

The migration set reserves id block `2000`, so it composes with the journal's
and the run store's without collision.

## Use the store

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const store = yield* CacheStore.CacheStore
  return yield* store.get("compile-server-v1")
})

Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, cache).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.orDie))
```

The database layer is scoped, so the program is run under `Effect.scoped`.

## Prefer the engine's composition

A host that runs flows rarely builds this by hand.
[`@smthrs/engine-store`](/api/engine-store) already composes the step cache
with the journal and the run store, and its `Migrations.sets` installs every
table in dependency order, which matters: the migrator decides what to run from
a single high-water mark, so the sets must be ordered by id block. Reach for
this guide when you need the store on its own, for a tool that inspects or
prunes a cache file, or when you are composing a shared tier under a custom
engine.

## Where to go next

- [Share results across machines](./share-results-across-machines.md): put a
  shared HTTP tier behind this local one.
- [Test against the step cache](./test-with-the-cache.md): the same store over
  an in-memory database.
- [The head and the ledger](../concepts/head-and-ledger.md): what the two
  tables you just created are for.
