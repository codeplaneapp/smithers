/**
 * The sweep half of artifact garbage collection: enumerate this host's blobs
 * and delete one, fenced by its age.
 *
 * This surface is deliberately NOT part of `ArtifactStore.Service`. The store
 * contract is shared by memory, filesystem, and network tiers, and a remote
 * tier can neither enumerate its address space nor accept a delete — Bazel
 * draws the same line: its disk-cache collector
 * (class `DiskCacheGarbageCollector` in
 * `com.google.devtools.build.lib.remote.disk`) walks the local directory, while
 * the remote tier owns its own retention. Only the
 * host-local filesystem store implements this.
 *
 * The *policy* — which digests are live, how old a dead blob must be before it
 * goes — belongs to the engine composition, which is the only place the
 * durable roots (attempt rows, cache entries) are visible. This module ships
 * mechanics alone; `@smthrs/engine-store` owns the mark policy and grace
 * period.
