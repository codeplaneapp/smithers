/**
 * Pins issue #92: `DurableEngineState.make` creates schema objects outside
 * the journal migration ladder — the run-parent table and its indexes, the
 * GC trigger (SQLite-only syntax), and the stale-running partial index — and
 * a future Postgres/PGlite backend dies at layer construction on them. They
 * were previously inline `sql` literals with no machine-readable inventory,
 * so the porting plan in the database roadmap
 * could omit them silently.
 *
 * The inventory in `internal/EngineStateSchema` is now the single source of
 * truth, and this test diffs the database's schema objects across `make` to
 * prove nothing is created that the inventory does not declare.
