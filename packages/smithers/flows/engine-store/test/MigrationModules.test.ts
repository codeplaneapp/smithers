/**
 * The migration modules export named bindings and no default export.
 *
 * The CommonJS build converts each source file with esbuild in Node interop
 * mode. There a default import of a sibling module resolves to that module's
 * whole exports object (`{ __esModule, default }`) instead of the Effect, so
 * `set.migrations["0001_initial"].pipe` was undefined under `require` while
 * the ESM build kept working. A named export has one shape in both formats,
 * and the second case here fails as soon as a default export comes back.
