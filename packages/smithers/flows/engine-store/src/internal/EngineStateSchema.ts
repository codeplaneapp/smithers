 * Each durable package owns its migration ladder. Spawn edges and their GC
 * trigger moved into engine-store migration 0006. The remaining
 * statements are engine-store-owned storage created idempotently at
 * construction instead (issues #40/#41/#79/#81). That is a deliberate lane
 * boundary, not an oversight — but it left the statements invisible to the
 * pg-porting plan in the database roadmap, which
 * scoped only the journal migration's SQLite-specific DDL. Declaring them here
 * makes the inventory machine-readable: a test diffs the database's schema
 * objects across `make` against this list, so no engine-owned statement can
 * be added without appearing in the porting inventory (issue #92).
