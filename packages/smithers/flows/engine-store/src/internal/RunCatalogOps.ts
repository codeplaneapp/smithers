/**
 * The workspace run catalog read.
 *
 * `@smthrs/sync` serves a workspace subscription over a `RunCatalog`, and
 * every implementation of that service was static (`layerStatic`,
 * `layerNoop`) or in-process (`makeMemory`, which hears only about runs the
 * same process registered). A follower composed against any of them saw the
 * runs that existed when it started and never learned of another run, so a
 * second engine writing to the same workspace was invisible to it. This
 * module is the durable half of the fix: the read that says which runs the
 * workspace has right now, taken from `flows_runs` itself.
 *
 * The read is a full set rather than a cursor tail, for one reason: retention
 * deletes runs. A follower that only ever appended what appeared after a
 * cursor would keep every collected run in its view forever and hold a
 * journal stream open for each one. Reading the set makes both directions
 * work, and the workspace's own bound keeps the cost of it flat.
 *
 * Nothing here polls. The interval belongs to the catalog that consumes this
 * read (`RunCatalog.makePolling` in `@smthrs/sync`), so the durable side has
 * no policy and no fiber of its own.
