/**
 * The repair step: one failing verification round, handed back with the

 *
 * A separate action rather than a retry of {@link module:Transform} because the
 * two are asked different questions. Transform is given a unit and the mapping;
 * repair is given a unit, the mapping, and the exact output of the command that
 * refused the rewrite. Keeping them apart also keeps the journal readable: a
 * reader can see how many rounds a unit cost and what each one was told.
 *
 * The brief a repair round receives is re-captured, so the sources it reads are
 * the ones on disk after the previous round edited them, not the ones the unit
 * started with.
