/**
 * The one JSON-with-comments reader this package uses.
 *
 * A `tsconfig.json` is JSON with comments by convention and by TypeScript's
 * own parser, and every reader of one here needs the same stripping. Scanned
 * rather than matched, because a tsconfig is full of text that looks like a
 * comment and is not: `"include": ["**\/*.ts", "**\/*.tsx"]` carries two `/*`
 * sequences and one `*\/` between them, so a regular expression that treats
 * them as a block comment deletes the middle of the include list and leaves
 * valid JSON naming the wrong files. A trailing comma has the same hazard in
 * the other direction: a string value containing `,}` is not a trailing comma,
 * and a regular expression cannot tell the difference. The scanner tracks
 * whether it is inside a string, so a comment is only a comment and a comma is
 * only a trailing comma outside one.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0-rc.0
