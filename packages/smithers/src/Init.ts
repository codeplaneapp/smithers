/**
 * `smthrs init`: the smallest project a flow can be run from.
 *
 * rc.0 scaffolds one thing, a markdown flow at `flows/<name>/flow.mdx`, and
 * makes one edit, adding `.flows/` to the repository's ignore file. The 0.x
 * ceremony, interactive agent selection, a workflow pack, a global
 * `~/.smithers` install, and skill installation as a side effect, is gone: seats
 * resolve from environment keys, and every side effect a command performs
 * without being asked is a side effect an operator has to undo.
 *
 * The one thing the scaffold reads from the host is its seat. `smthrs up`
 * cannot run a prompt flow that declares none, so a scaffold without a
 * `model:` line is a scaffold that is not launchable, which is what rc.0 first
 * shipped (release rehearsal). {@link defaultSeat} chooses it from
 * the same environment keys `smthrs doctor` reports.
 *
 * The ignore edit is idempotent and repository-scoped, carried over from the
 * 0.x `ensureRootGitignore` requirement: append once, never inside a
 * non-repository directory, and never a second time when a rule already
 * covers the path.
