/**
 * `smthrs serve`: the workspace gateway over HTTP, for the product UI and
 * for any client that is not this process.
 *
 * The assembly is `@smthrs/gateway`'s: the control plane on `/rpc`, the served
 * projections on `/projections`, the journal read path on `/sync`, and an
 * unauthenticated `GET /health` a supervisor probes to learn which workspace a
 * gateway belongs to. This module owns the two decisions the verb has to make:
 * whether the requested bind is allowed at all, and what it says it is
 * serving.
 *
 * The bind rule is strict: loopback needs no bearer and accepts only loopback
 * Host values and browser origins; anything else needs both an explicit
 * `--listen` and a bearer token. It is
 * spelled out here, as data, because the failure mode it prevents,
 * an unauthenticated control plane on a laptop's LAN address, able to launch
 * agents with the operator's credentials, is silent when it happens.
 *
 * The banner is derived from {@link mounts}, the same list the composition is
 * built from, so it cannot advertise a route that answers 404.
