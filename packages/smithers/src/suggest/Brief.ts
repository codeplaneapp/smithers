 * fewest words that make a written flow launchable: a `flow.mdx` whose
 * frontmatter declares the seat, the capabilities, and a budget, and whose
 * body is the prompt; and, when the repository already carries `PACKAGE.ts`
 * files, a target in one of them. The agent is told to read what exists
 * before writing, so a repository's own conventions beat the sample here.

# Review the change

Run \`git diff\` through the \`bash\` tool and read the changed files in full.

## Check

- Every exported value carries a JSDoc block.
- No test was deleted without a note saying why.

## Report

List each finding with the file and line, then say whether the change is ready.`
