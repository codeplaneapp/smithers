title: "Record a score exactly once"
description: "Build a durable job identity, claim it with recordOnce, and understand what a retry, a crash, and a rolled-back transaction each do to the claim."

Scoring is retried: a batch is re-dispatched, a process crashes and resumes, a
queue redelivers. Without a claim, each retry appends another row for work that
already happened, and the score history stops being a history. `recordOnce`
makes the write idempotent against an identity you choose.

## Build the identity

```ts
import { Runner } from "@smthrs/scorers"

const identity = Runner.jobIdentity(["run-1", "greet/ada", contains.scorerKey])
```

`jobIdentity` length-prefixes every component under a `v1` prefix, so no
character inside a component can imitate a boundary:

```text
v1:5:run-1:9:greet/ada:64:9aa8b7b36ddaf6599509edf03e0eef728b2fba7c96ec5cc51f74b5e4d3b7a769
```

Never build an identity by joining strings with a delimiter. Joining lets two
different tuples produce one identity, and one shared identity silently drops
every observation after the first. The only consumer of this package built its
identity by joining five unconstrained strings with `NUL`, which is why this
constructor exists.

Three properties make an identity correct:

- **Non-empty**, and at most `ScoreStore.maxIdentityBytes` (512) UTF-8 bytes.
  Either violation fails with code `invalid_request` naming the problem.
- **Stable across a restart.** An identity derived from a process id, a random
  value, or a wall clock defeats the whole mechanism: the retry after a crash
  claims a fresh identity and records a second observation for the same work.
- **Unique per unit of work.** A run id, the target step key, and the scorer
  key are the usual three components, because together they name exactly one
  grading attempt.

## Claim and write in one transaction

```ts
import { ScoreStore } from "@smthrs/scorers"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const store = yield* ScoreStore.ScoreStore
  return yield* store.recordOnce(identity, {
    kind: "score",
    targetStepKey: "greet/ada",
    scorerKey: contains.scorerKey,
    score: 1,
    at: Date.now()
  })
})
```

`recordOnce` returns `true` when it claimed the identity and wrote the
observation, and `false` when the identity was already claimed and nothing was
written. Both happen inside one transaction: the claim row in
`flows_score_jobs` and the observation row in `flows_scores` commit together or
not at all.

A [runner](./run-a-batch-of-scorers.md) calls this for you with the job's
`identity`, so most callers never invoke it directly. `runBatchCorrelated`
reports the answer as `recorded: "persisted"` or `recorded: "duplicate"`.

## What each failure does to the claim

- **A failure inside the transaction rolls the claim back**, so the job can be
  retried. `test/ScoreStore.test.ts` proves this with a real SQL failure, and
  proves a committed claim survives a process restart against the same file.
- **A contradictory driver result fails the whole transaction.** The claim is a
  single-row insert with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so it may affect only zero
  or one row. Zero is the duplicate path and one proceeds to the observation
  insert; any other count rolls everything back rather than guessing.
- **A rejected observation never opens a transaction.** The observation is
  validated and fully encoded when `recordOnce` is called, so an invalid one
  fails before the claim exists and before the single-writer lock is taken.

The affected-row count is read through `DurableWriter.affectedRows`, which is
dialect-agnostic and accepts the bigint that `SqlClient.SafeIntegers` produces.
Reading a driver's own numeric `changes` treated that bigint as "already
claimed", committed the claim, and dropped the observation forever on every
retry. The details are in [Durability](../durability.md#idempotency).

## When you want repetition instead

`recordOnce` is for one unit of work recorded once. Scoring the same target
repeatedly over time is a different intent, and `record` is the entry point for
it: it appends without a claim, and the store keeps every row. See
[Observations](../concepts/observations.md#repetition-is-expected).

## Next

- [Read scores back](./read-scores-back.md): page a long history and aggregate
  it.
- [Durability](../durability.md): what the store refuses to persist, and what
  it never prunes.
