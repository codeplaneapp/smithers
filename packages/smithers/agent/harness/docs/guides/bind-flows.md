A cell's only authority is `ctx.call(flowName, input)`, so every capability an
agent can reach has to arrive as an ordinary flow declaration plus the code
that runs it. Standard host capabilities, incoming MCP tools, and subagents
all take this one shape. `FlowBinding` pairs the two halves; `CellCalls`
resolves a call name against the registry and dispatches to the body the
declaration names.

## Bind one flow

`FlowBinding.make` takes a flow declaration and a handler:

```ts
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"
import * as FlowBinding from "@smthrs/harness/FlowBinding"

const echo = FlowBinding.make({
  flow: {
    name: "echo",
    description: "Echo one string back.",
    input: Schema.Struct({ text: Schema.String }),
    output: Schema.Struct({ text: Schema.String, length: Schema.Number }),
    capabilities: ["fs:read:/**"],
    effects: { reads: ["/**"], writes: [], mode: "hermetic", onConflict: "serialize", tier: "sealed" }
  },
  handler: (input) => Effect.succeed({ text: input.text, length: input.text.length })
})
```

The declaration is the `FlowBinding.Declared` shape plus `input` and `output`
schemas; the `Flow.make` declarations of [`@smthrs/core`](/api/core) satisfy
it as-is. The handler receives the decoded input and the `Cell.Call` itself,
because a handler that opens a durable boundary of its own needs
`call.identity` as a replay-stable name for it.

A binding is `{ descriptor, run }`:

- `descriptor` is an ordinary `FlowDescriptor` from
  [`@smthrs/registry`](/api/registry), projected by
  `FlowBinding.descriptorOf`. `make` derives the body's content digest from
  the handler source and renders both schemas as inline JSON Schema documents,
  which is what puts a parameter schema beside the flow in `ctx.flows`.
- `run` decodes the call's input through the input schema, executes the
  handler, and validates the handler's output back into serializable JSON.

A handler with remaining service requirements produces a `Binding<R>`; close
them with `FlowBinding.provide(binding, context)` before composing.

## How a call settles

Inside `run`, every failure lands where the cell contract says it must:

- Input the schema rejects settles as a catchable `invalid_input` failure
  without running the handler. A first attempt that fails on an explicit
  `null` retries once with the null keys dropped, the JavaScript reading of an
  omitted optional key.
- A handler failure settles as a catchable `flow_failed`, with the failure
  rendered as bounded stable text.
- Output the output schema rejects, or that is not serializable, settles as
  `flow_failed` naming which.
- A permission requirement, a denial, or any harness-level failure stays in
  the error channel as a `HarnessError` with code `suspended`, so a cell can
  never catch its own permission park.

## Compose a catalog

`FlowBinding.Source` produces bindings, possibly effectfully, so a lazily
connected server or a plugin contributes without being resolved at import
time. `FlowBinding.source(name, bindings)` lifts a fixed list into one.
`FlowBinding.catalog` resolves ordered sources into one
`FlowBinding.Catalog`:

```ts
const catalog = await Effect.runPromise(
  FlowBinding.catalog([FlowBinding.source("standard", [echo])])
)
```

A catalog refuses two implementations under one name: `catalogResult` fails
with a `HarnessError` of code `assembly_failed`, because one descriptor
dispatched to another implementation is how a call runs the wrong body. An
unnamed binding fails the same way with its own message.
`FlowBinding.empty()` is the empty catalog.

## Disclose through a registry

`FlowBinding.registry(base, catalog)` discloses a catalog's descriptors
through an existing `Registry.Registry`:

- File-discovered entries keep their names: a binding whose name a discovery
  source already found is not disclosed, and the shadowed binding is reported
  as an ordinary `duplicate_name` warning. Discovery precedence stays exactly
  where discovery put it.
- `list`, `visible`, `getOption`, and `get` answer from both sources; body
  loading, prompt rendering, and refresh pass through to the base registry.

## Resolve calls with CellCalls

`CellCalls.make` turns a call name into the body that answers it:

```ts
import * as CellCalls from "@smthrs/harness/CellCalls"

const resolver = CellCalls.make({
  registry,
  catalog,
  implementations: new Map(),
  prompt: runMarkdownFlow
})
```

The resolver's `run` has exactly the shape a durable host's call runner
consumes, so the host wires it in behind `EngineLike.call`. Resolution works
in this order:

1. The registry must know the name, or the call settles `unknown_flow`.
2. The descriptor must be model-invocable, or the call settles
   `capability_refused`.
3. The descriptor's declaration digest must equal the digest folded into the
   call's identity, or the call settles `declaration_changed`. The registry is
   refreshable, and this check is what keeps a call bound to the declaration
   the agent was shown.
4. An executable binding answers first, after an identity check that the
   binding's declaration is the disclosed one. A markdown flow renders against
   the call's arguments and runs through the `CellCalls.PromptRunner` the host
   supplied, or settles `unimplemented` when the host runs none. Anything else
   dispatches to the host's `Implementation` for the name, or settles
   `unimplemented`.

Every refusal is a `failure` `Cell.CallResult` the cell catches; nothing here
throws a refusal across the boundary.
