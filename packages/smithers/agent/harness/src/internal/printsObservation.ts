/**
 * The one rendering of a frame's print buffer into the turn that reads it.
 *
 * The controller journals the RAW buffer as `AgentEvent.CellPrinted` and sends
 * this rendering to the model, so a projection that replays the raw text
 * rebuilds a window the run never had. Both callers go through here for that
 * reason: `CellTurn` when it builds the next turn, and `Transcript` when it
 * rebuilds one from the journal.
 *
 * An empty buffer is a message and not a silence. A cell that printed nothing
 * still opened a turn, and the turn it opened says so — dropping it loses a
 * user message the model actually read, and the model is told the realm still
 * holds everything the cell bound, which is the recovery it needs.
