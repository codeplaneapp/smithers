/**
 * Repository coordinates, validated before they become a request path.

 * This module exists because encoding is not enough. `encodeURIComponent("..")`
 * is `".."`, since dots are unreserved, and a hand-written `%2E%2E` is decoded
 * before the WHATWG URL parser removes dot segments, so
 * `new URL("https://api.github.com/repos/%2E%2E/%2E%2E/user/hooks").pathname`
 * is `/user/hooks`. An owner or repository interpolated straight into a path
 * therefore walks a token-bearing request to another GitHub endpoint, and the
 * client's origin pin does not help: the traversal stays on the configured
 * origin, so the bearer token goes with it.
 *
 * Every path this package builds from an owner and a repository goes through
 * {@link repositoryPath}, which validates each segment against GitHub's own
 * naming rules and only then encodes it.
