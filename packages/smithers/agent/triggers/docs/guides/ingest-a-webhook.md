A webhook door has four parts: a name, a payload schema, a verifier, and a
mapping from a verified payload to a start or a signal. `Webhook.make` assembles
them into something whose only dispatch path is the Control channel
coordinator.

## Declare the door

```ts
import type { CredentialRef } from "@smthrs/control/Credential"
import * as Webhook from "@smthrs/triggers/Webhook"
import * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const Push = Schema.Struct({
  repository: Schema.String,
  ref: Schema.String
})

const credential = Redacted.make<CredentialRef>({ id: "github-webhook", name: "github" })

const verify = Webhook.makeSignatureVerifier({
  header: "x-hub-signature-256",
  expected: signature
})

const inbound = (payload: typeof Push.Type) => ({
  start: {
    flowId: "ci/build",
    input: { repository: payload.repository, ref: payload.ref }
  }
})

export const github = Webhook.make({ name: "github", schema: Push, credential, verify, inbound })
```

`credential` is required. It is a reference to a stored secret, not the secret,
and the channel forwards it to the verifier on every request.

`inbound` returns a start or a signal, and nothing else. It cannot supply
capabilities or an execution envelope. See
[Authority-free channels](../concepts/channels.md).

## Write the signature function

`makeSignatureVerifier` handles the header lookup and the comparison. You supply
the expected bytes:

```ts
import type { CredentialRef } from "@smthrs/control/Credential"
import type { TriggerError } from "@smthrs/triggers/TriggerError"
import type * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import type * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted"

declare const signature: (
  body: Uint8Array,
  credential: Redacted.Redacted<CredentialRef>
) => Effect.Effect<Uint8Array, TriggerError>
```

Three properties of that signature are the point of it.

- It returns an `Effect`, so the secret is resolved through the host's resolver
  per request rather than captured in a closure at declaration time. A
  resolution or HMAC failure arrives as a typed `verification_failed` instead of
  a defect that kills the fiber.
- The `body` it receives is a private copy. Nothing it does to those bytes can
  reach the buffer that is about to be fingerprinted and decoded.
- Its result is compared with `Webhook.constantTimeEqual`, which iterates
  exactly `expected.length` times and folds the length difference into the
  result. The iteration count is fixed by the secret side of the comparison and
  never by the caller's, so a caller cannot lengthen its input until the work
  stops growing and learn the expected signature's length.

The verifier looks the header up first in lowercase and then exactly as written,
so `x-hub-signature-256` and `X-Hub-Signature-256` both resolve. An absent header
becomes a zero-length byte string and fails.

## Register once, then accept traffic

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const startup = Effect.gen(function*() {
  yield* github.register
})
```

`register` requires `Channels` from [`@smthrs/control`](/api/control). Call it
at startup. `ingest` deliberately does not register, so traffic arriving at a
door nobody opened is reported as unavailable rather than silently opening it.

## Hand it the request

```ts
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

const handle = (request: Request, deliveryId: string) =>
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    const body = new Uint8Array(yield* Effect.promise(() => request.arrayBuffer()))
    return yield* github.ingest({
      body,
      headers: Object.fromEntries(request.headers),
      idempotencyKey: deliveryId
    })
  })
```

`idempotencyKey` is the transport's own delivery id. Control deduplicates on it,
so a webhook provider that retries a delivery gets an `AlreadyApplied` receipt
and the flow starts once.

`ingest` answers with a Control `Receipt` and fails with either a
`TriggerError` or a `ControlError`:

| Failure                                           | Cause                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TriggerError` with `code: "verification_failed"` | The signature did not verify, or the credential could not be resolved. Nothing was decoded and no Control operation ran. |
| `InvalidInput`                                    | The signature verified and the payload did not fit the declared schema.                                                  |
| Other `ControlError` values                       | The control plane refused or could not accept the operation.                                                             |

## Project run state outbound

A door that also reports back adds `outbound`, which maps a `RunSummary` to
whatever the transport posts:

```ts
export const reporting = Webhook.make({
  name: "github",
  schema: Push,
  credential,
  verify,
  inbound,
  outbound: (run) => ({ state: run.status })
})
```

Omit it and the projection is a `noop` operation carrying the run's cursor.

## Declaring a channel without a webhook

`Channel.make` is the same declaration without the Control door around it, for a
transport that is not HTTP request and response. It adds no authority and no
execution behavior; it is the typing seam and nothing else.
