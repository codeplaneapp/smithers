/**
 * Two `SqlControlRuntime` instances over one database file, claiming one run
 * idempotency key.
 *
 * `RunIdempotencyRace.test.ts` races whole control stacks; this suite pins the
 * seam the race resolves on. Every other verb claims a durable key row before
 * its side effect (`control_plan_keys` for plans), and the run verb was the
 * exception: two processes that both missed the receipt lookup both launched,
 * and the loser's run row outlived the `recordMutation` refusal that followed.
 * `control_run_keys` closes that hole the same way — the claim is the
 * mutation's first write, so the loser learns it lost before a run row exists
 * and converges on the winner's receipt instead.
