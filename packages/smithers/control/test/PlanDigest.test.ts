/**
 * Golden vectors for `PlanCard.digest`.
 *
 * Every approval is bound to this digest: `ApprovalTarget` carries it, both
 * runtimes compare against it, and a recorded approval that no longer matches
 * is refused with `PlanDigestMismatch`. Until now no test named a value, only
 * its shape, so any change to the hashed preimage would have passed the suite
 * while silently invalidating every approval already recorded in a
 * `.flows/control.db`.
 *
 * THE LITERALS BELOW ARE A WIRE CONTRACT. Changing one is a breaking change
 * for every persisted approval, not a test update. If a change makes them move,
 * that is the finding.
 *
 * The one exception already taken: the enveloped vector's budget named a `usd`
 * key `Envelope` has never carried, so it described a plan no caller could
 * submit and the type checker refused it. The literal beside it was regenerated
 * for `{ tokens: 5 }`. No envelope a caller can build hashes differently
 * because of it.
