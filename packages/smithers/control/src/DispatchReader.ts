 * Read port from the control plane into a trigger store.

 * package already depends on this one (its scheduler launches runs through
 * `Control`), so the adapter over a real `TriggerStore` is composed by the host
 * and the plane only ever sees the interface.
 *
 * A composition that provides no reader, or provides {@link layerNone}, makes
 * `Control.list` refuse the two variants with a typed `InvalidInput` naming the
 * gap. It never answers an empty page: an empty page means "this host has no
 * triggers", and a host that cannot read its store has no grounds to say so.
