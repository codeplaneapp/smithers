 * a supervisor produces: an ordered sweep of `bound + 1` runs evicts the fold
 * the next read is about to want, so every poll replays every journal from
 * sequence zero instead of reading its tail. Under pressure this instead
 * sacrifices the NEWEST fold no later read has reused, so a sweep of any width
 * keeps every fold it has read twice and pays for its width in a fixed handful
 * of refolds. Only when every retained fold has been reused does it fall back
 * to evicting the oldest, and it then clears the reuse marks so a fold cannot
 * hold a slot on one ancient read forever.
