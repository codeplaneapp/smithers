/**
 * The byte bound every version probe collects its standard output under.
 *
 * Two seams in this package spawn a tool and read one line of version back.
 * Both are handed a stream by a child they do not control, so both need the
 * same refusal: stop at a fixed number of bytes rather than buffer whatever a
 * misbehaving or hostile executable decides to print. The bound lived beside
 * one of the two probes and was applied by that one alone, while the other
 * exported an identically named constant that nothing read.
 *
 * Decoding happens after the bound, never before, so a stream is refused on the
 * bytes it actually produced rather than on a decoder's view of them.
 *
 * Nothing here is reachable from outside the package: the export map maps
 * `./internal/*` to `null`.
