/**
 * `S.Docs.Page`: one generated documentation page, written by an agent under
 * the `docs` verb.
 *
 * A page is the docs-shaped subset of `Agent.Diff`. The writer reads one
 * `brief` (the human-owned paragraph saying what the page is for), one
 * `prompt` (the page-type instructions), the `references` it may consult,
 * and the `inputs` the page describes, then writes exactly one `output`
 * file. The output path is the whole write-set: a page writer that touches
 * any other path is rejected whole, the same as an `Agent.Diff` candidate
 * escaping `changes`.
 *
 * The rule exists because of verbs, not payloads. `Agent.Diff` is a `run`
 * target, and `run` is the interactive verb: it is not aggregated by `ci`,
 * and `smithers-build docs //apps/site/...` cannot select it. A page writer
 * has to answer the `docs` verb so a person regenerates stale pages with one
 * command. It must also stay out of the aggregate `ci` verb, which plans
 * `docs`: the package executor lists `Docs.Page` among the attended rules
 * `ci` skips, because CI never spawns an agent. The freshness check that
 * makes a stale committed page fail under `ci` is a separate, deterministic
 * rule.
 *
 * The body is one sealed {@link AgentTarget.AgentDiff} call: the attrs project
 * to the same {@link AgentTarget.DiffPayload} an equivalent `Agent.Diff`
 * declaration plans, so the executor's existing diff lane runs the page
 * writer and no second agent loop exists.
