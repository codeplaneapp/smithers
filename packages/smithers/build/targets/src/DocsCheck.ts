/**
 * `S.Docs.Check`: the freshness gate for a file an agent wrote.
 *
 * `Agent.Diff` and `Docs.Page` are `cache: false` because an agent is not a
 * pure function of its inputs, so the tree itself is the cache: a generated
 * page is committed beside a stamp recording the content key of every input
 * the writer read and the digest of the page it produced. This rule
 * recomputes that key and fails, deterministically and without spawning an
 * agent, when the committed page is older than what produced it.
 *
 * The key is not a hash this module invents. The planner already digests
 * every declared input at plan time (`Workspace.ExpandedInput.files`, one
 * `{path, digest}` row per file); {@link closureDigest} is that same encoding
 * applied to the union of the rows the `inputs` attr resolves to. The verdict
 * and the node's own cache key are therefore computed from the same bytes by
 * construction. It deliberately is not the node's key preview: that folds in
 * the executor implementation fingerprint, the attrs schema identity, and the
 * execution mode, so a committed stamp equal to it would rot on every build
 * tool release rather than only when an input moved.
 *
 * One sidecar per page, not one manifest per package: a shared manifest makes
 * every regeneration a merge conflict and every stale page a site-wide red,
 * while a sidecar fails one page and diffs beside it.
