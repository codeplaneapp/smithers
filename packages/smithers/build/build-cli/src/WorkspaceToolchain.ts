/**
 * The package manager and runtime a target resolves from the workspace.
 *
 * `WORKSPACE.ts` declares the workspace's package manager and runtime once.
 * Before this module every PACKAGE.ts restated them: the root declaration
 * exported `packageManager` and `runtime` values and ~75 package declarations
 * imported them back so they could pass them as attrs. That is the workspace's
 * business, not a package's, and the import direction is the wrong one anyway
 * — `PackageLoader` refuses a PACKAGE.ts that imports WORKSPACE.ts.
 *
 * A rule now names the attrs it resolves from the workspace
 * ({@link Target.Metadata.workspaceAttrs}) and leaves them optional. The
 * planner fills each named attr in here, before it keys the node and before it
 * runs the body, so the manager and the interpreter stay key material and the
 * rule bodies keep computing their own argv from one declaration. A
 * declaration that passes the attr explicitly always wins: that is how the Bun
 * compatibility matrix re-runs a package's suite under a second interpreter.
