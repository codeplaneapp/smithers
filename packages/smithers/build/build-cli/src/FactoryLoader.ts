 * factory declaration under the export name `factory`, and at most one home
 * declaration under the export name `home`. It may import `WORKSPACE.ts`
 * and its siblings; it never imports a `PACKAGE.ts`, which the loader's
 * static import scan enforces, because a factory names the targets it needs
 * by label (`S.label("//:ci")`) and never by value. `Smithers.Flow` values
 * exported beside the factory are plain data and pass through.
