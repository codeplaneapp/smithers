# The jjhub-hosted cache

jjhub (Smithers Cloud) hosts a build cache for every repository it serves. It
speaks the same `/ac` and `/cas` protocol as `build.smithers.sh` and the
self-hosted Postgres service, so the CLI, the engine, and their tests do not
know which backend answered. What jjhub adds is the credential model: a
repository commits a public read token, every clone and every CI job reads the
shared cache with no secret at all, and publishing still needs a real
credential.

## Local first

Nothing changes about the local tier. A local hit never touches the remote, a
remote hit hydrates the local file, a put writes both, and any remote failure
prints one warning and degrades the run to local-only. The jjhub cache is the
remote tier of the same read-through store.

## Zero configuration in a jjhub checkout

When the root `PACKAGE.ts` declares no remote cache and `SMITHERS_CACHE_URL` is
unset, `smithers-build` looks at the workspace's git remotes (the colocated
`.git/config`, then the jj git backend's config) for a jjhub host and uses
that repository's cache endpoint. Reads go out anonymously, which a public
repository answers; a private repository refuses them with 401, and the store
degrades to local-only with the usual single warning. The first time this
happens in a process the CLI says so on standard error and names the command
that makes it permanent:

```text
smthrs: using the jjhub build cache for acme/app (no declaration; anonymous reads, SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN publishes). Run `smithers cache connect` to commit a read token.
```

`SMITHERS_CACHE_DISCOVERY=0` turns discovery off. `SMITHERS_JJHUB_HOSTS` adds
the hosts of a self-hosted deployment, and `SMITHERS_JJHUB_API_URL` its API
base.

## Committing a read token

```sh
smithers cache connect
```

mints a public read token for the repository and writes one line into the
root `PACKAGE.ts`, after the imports:

```ts
export const remoteCache = Smithers.RemoteCache.jjhub({ repo: "acme/app", publicReadToken: "smithers_cachero_…" })
```

Commit it. The token has exactly one power: reading `acme/app`'s cache. It is
refused with `403` on every `PUT` and `DELETE` before the body is read, it is
not accepted on any other repository's cache, and the general token loader
never accepts its shape, so it authenticates nothing else on jjhub. A leaked
one costs a rotation (`smithers cache token revoke`, then `connect` again) and
nothing more. This is the posture of an Nx read-only access token.

`Smithers.RemoteCache.make` accepts the same `publicReadToken` option for a
non-jjhub endpoint that enforces the same split. The literal is the only
credential that may appear in `PACKAGE.ts`: any string that is not a public read
token is refused at declaration time, so a personal token pasted by mistake
never lands in a committed file.

## Publishing

Writes need a credential with `write:repository` on the repository. The
declaration's `write` secret names the environment variable, and it defaults
to `SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN`:

```sh
export SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN='<a smithers_ token with write:repository>'
smithers-build ci //...
```

Inside an agent computer nothing is exported: the per-run repository token is
bound to `SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN` through the egress proxy, the guest holds only
a placeholder, and `SMITHERS_CACHE_URL` already names the repository cache.

## Generated CI

`GithubCiGen` needs no cache secret for reads when the root declaration
carries a public read token, because the workflow evaluates `PACKAGE.ts` and
finds the literal there. Declare `cacheWriteTokenSecret` and mark the trunk
jobs `publishesToCache: true` for publication; the read credential is the
committed token, the write credential is a repository secret rendered only
into those jobs. The trust model is unchanged: readers are untrusted, writers
are post-merge trunk jobs.

## Managing tokens

```sh
smithers cache token create --repo acme/app --name ci
smithers cache token list --repo acme/app
smithers cache token revoke --repo acme/app --id 3
```

Token management calls need a first-class credential with write permission on
the repository; the cache routes themselves never accept one.

## Where the bytes live

Action entries are rows in jjhub's Postgres, artifacts are objects in its blob
store under a repository-scoped key, and every row carries the repository id,
so two repositories never share a namespace even when their keys collide. The
bounds, status codes, first-writer-wins conflict semantics, fenced deletes,
`findMissing`, admission caps, and the 503-never-404 rule are the ones
[Remote caching](remote-caching.md) documents for the other two services.
