/*
 * The protocol's storage, on Postgres.
 *
 * Every statement is a Bun SQL tagged template, so every client value is a
 * bound parameter and never text spliced into SQL. The tables are the ones in
 * migrations/0001_initial.sql.
 *
 * `sql` arrives as an argument rather than as a module-level connection, so
 * these functions are testable against a fake and the module opens nothing on
 * import.
 *
 * Transaction assumptions
 * -----------------------
 * `actionCache.put` and `contentStore.put` need more than one statement, and
 * each runs its statements in one transaction. They assume the following,
 * all of which hold at Postgres' default
 * READ COMMITTED isolation, so the service never has to set an isolation level
 * and never has to retry a serialization failure:
 *
 *   1. `pg_advisory_xact_lock` is held to commit and is released by commit or
 *      by rollback, including a rollback the client never sees because the
 *      connection died. It is therefore safe to take it and never release it
 *      explicitly.
 *   2. Two publishers of one key fold to one advisory lock id, so at most one
 *      of them is between the insert and the commit at any moment. The id is a
 *      32-bit fold, so unrelated keys may collide; a collision costs
 *      serialization and never correctness.
 *   3. `SELECT ... FOR NO KEY UPDATE` conflicts with `DELETE`, so the row the
 *      classification describes cannot be released before this transaction
 *      commits. Under READ COMMITTED a row deleted by a transaction that
 *      committed first is dropped from the result rather than returned stale,
 *      which is what makes the vanished case observable as zero rows.
 *   4. `SELECT ... FOR KEY SHARE` on `smithers_build_artifact` conflicts with a
 *      release of those blobs, and under READ COMMITTED it drops a row a
 *      concurrent transaction already deleted. Reference recording therefore
 *      cannot raise a foreign-key violation against the artifact side, and
 *      cannot attach to an entry row this transaction does not hold.
 *   5. An error aborts the whole transaction. Nothing here catches one, so a
 *      failed publication writes nothing and reaches the client as a 503 it
 *      retries, never as a half-recorded entry.
 *
 * `get`, `delete`, `has`, and `presentDigests` are single statements, which
 * Postgres already executes atomically, so none of them opens a transaction.
 * The reads carry their access-record refresh in that same statement, as a
 * data-modifying CTE that fires only outside the grace window
 * (`lruTouchGraceSeconds`); they answer from the read, never from the update.

 * blob some other reader just took, so touching on every read spends that write
 * to move a timestamp by milliseconds.
 *
 * Reads therefore refresh the record only once per window and otherwise read
 * without writing. The record is never more than this far behind the read it
 * describes, which is the only property eviction needs: release orders by
 * `last_accessed_at` against a cutoff an operator chooses to be older than the
 * longest expected publication (migrations/0001_initial.sql), and this window
