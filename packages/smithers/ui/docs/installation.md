`@smthrs/ui` is `private: true` and workspace-only at `1.0.0-rc.0`. It is
published to no registry, so `npm install` cannot reach it. Consume it through
the pnpm workspace, the way `apps/ui` and `apps/review` do.

## Requirements

| Requirement                | Value                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| React                      | `^19.0.0`, as a peer dependency, together with `react-dom ^19.0.0` |
| A bundler that reads TypeScript | The package ships `src/` directly, with no `dist/`             |
| A CSS-capable host         | None. The stylesheet travels as a JavaScript string                |

The package sets `"files": ["src/"]`, and every condition in its `exports` map
points at a `.ts` or `.tsx` source. Your bundler compiles those sources as part
of your app, so it must handle TSX and the `react-jsx` runtime. That is also why
the package's `tsc --noEmit` gate matters to you: it is the only thing between a
type error in a component and your build.

## Add the dependency

Declare the workspace protocol in your app's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@smthrs/ui": "workspace:*",
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
  }
}
```

Then install from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Import the package by its scoped name. The unscoped `smthrs` package publishes
only a deprecation notice whose module throws on import, so the scoped specifier
is the only one that resolves to components.

## Entry points

The root barrel is the component library. Every other subpath is either a
narrower slice of the same light surface or an adapter that carries a heavy
third-party renderer. Importing an adapter is a deliberate act, because the
adapter's dependency lands in your bundle.

| Specifier                             | What it exports                                                       | Heavy dependency  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `@smthrs/ui`                          | Every component, hook, token, and pure helper in the base library     | None              |
| `@smthrs/ui/status`                   | The status vocabulary alone                                            | None              |
| `@smthrs/ui/time`                     | `RelativeTime`, `useRelativeTime`, `formatRelativeTime`                | None              |
| `@smthrs/ui/calendar`                 | `Calendar`, its types, its CSS, and the date helpers                   | None              |
| `@smthrs/ui/vault`                    | Wikilinks, the graph model, the outline and backlinks panels, autosave | None              |
| `@smthrs/ui/adapters/chart`           | `ChartContainer` and the categorical series palette                    | `recharts`        |
| `@smthrs/ui/adapters/terminal`        | `Terminal`, an xterm.js render surface                                 | `@xterm/*`        |
| `@smthrs/ui/adapters/code-view`       | `CodeFileView`, one syntax-highlighted file                            | `@pierre/diffs`   |
| `@smthrs/ui/adapters/pierre-diff-view` | `PierreDiffView`, a syntax-highlighted patch                          | `@pierre/diffs`   |
| `@smthrs/ui/adapters/markdown-editor` | `MarkdownEditor`, the Milkdown Crepe surface                           | `@milkdown/*`     |
| `@smthrs/ui/adapters/knowledge-graph` | `KnowledgeGraph`, the force-directed vault graph                       | `d3-force`        |

The four subpaths without a heavy dependency exist for import ergonomics, not
for weight: everything they export is also on the root barrel. The six adapter
subpaths are the opposite, and reaching one is the only way to load its
dependency. For what each adapter costs and how the boundary is enforced, read
[The adapters boundary](./concepts/adapters.md).

## Render the stylesheet once

There is no `.css` file to import. The stylesheet is a JavaScript string, and
`SmithersUiStyles` renders it into a `<style>` element:

```tsx
import { SmithersUiStyles } from "@smthrs/ui"

export function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SmithersUiStyles />
      {/* the rest of your tree */}
    </>
  )
}
```

Render it exactly once per document. A host page that does not already inline
the theme tokens passes `withTheme` to get them:

```tsx
<SmithersUiStyles withTheme />
```

Every component also injects the sheet itself in the browser as a fallback, so a
forgotten element still produces styled output in a browser. The fallback cannot
help under `renderToStaticMarkup`, where effects never run. For the full model,
read [How styling ships](./concepts/styling.md).

## Verify the install

Render one component and confirm it carries the namespaced class:

```tsx
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from "react-dom/server"
import { Button, SmithersUiStyles } from "@smthrs/ui"

const html = renderToStaticMarkup(
  <>
    <SmithersUiStyles />
    <Button>Launch</Button>
  </>
)

console.log(html.includes("sui-button")) // true
```

## Next steps

- [Quickstart](./quickstart.md): build a working run panel from three
  components.
- [The adapters boundary](./concepts/adapters.md): what each heavy subpath
  costs before you import it.
- [API reference](./api.md): every public export.
