/**
 * `@smthrs/ui/adapters/knowledge-graph`
 *
 * The Obsidian-style vault graph. It renders over a `d3-force` simulation, so
 * like every other heavy renderer in this package it ships behind its own
 * package subpath and never through the base barrel: `export *` from the vault
 * lane used to pull 34 KB of d3-force into `src/index.ts` for every consumer,
 * including the ones that never render a graph. `tests/barrel-weight.test.ts`
 * holds that line.
 *
 * The pure graph math (`computeGraphModel`, `folderTint`, `nodeRadius`, ...)
 * has no heavy dependency and stays on `@smthrs/ui` and `@smthrs/ui/vault`.
