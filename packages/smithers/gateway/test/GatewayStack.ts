/**
 * A whole gateway over one real SQLite database.
 *
 * Every suite in this package runs against this: a durable journal, a durable
 * run store, the SQL control runtime, `ControlLive`, the served projections,
 * the sync read path, and the assembled HTTP surface bound to an ephemeral
 * loopback port. Nothing is stubbed below the control plane, because the
 * behaviours these suites pin — an approval projected out of a parked run, a
 * cancellation's attribution, a child run's visibility — are exactly the
 * places a mocked control plane would agree with the gateway and disagree
 * with production.
