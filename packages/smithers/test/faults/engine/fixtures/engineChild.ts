/**
 * The engine incarnation the crash family kills.
 *
 * A test cannot `SIGKILL` itself, so the engine under the fault has to be a
 * separate operating-system process with its own pid. This is that process. It
 * opens the real SQLite file, builds the production Node host, and executes the
 * flow — or, in `probe` mode, proves it can do all of that and exits without
 * executing anything.
 *
 * The protocol on stdout is two lines and nothing else:
 *
 * - `SMITHERS_ENGINE_HANDSHAKE=<phase>:<nonce>` — printed before any work. The
 *   phase is `probe` or `execute`, and they are distinct on purpose: an
 *   admission probe must never be replayable as evidence that a flow ran.
 * - `PROBE_STATUS=ok` (probe) or `RESULT_STATUS=<status>` (execute).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node engineChild.ts <filename> <executionId> <probe|execute> <markerDir> \
 *     <counterFile> <secondSleepMs> <nonce> <hostId>
