/**
 * Ownership resolution over the package index: which owners a changed path
 * resolves to, why, and under which agent policy; plus the two projections
 * of that answer, `.github/CODEOWNERS` and the per-directory `OWNERS` tree.
 *
 * The declarations are inert data on `S.Package` and `S.Workspace`
 * (`@smthrs/targets/Owners`). This module is the only place they meet the
 * package tree and the dependency graph, so the CLI's `owners` command, the
 * `owners()` and `rdeps()` queries, and the two generated-file rules all read
 * one resolution.
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * A path belongs to the deepest package whose directory contains it. Its
 * **direct** owners are that package's `owners` plus every `perFile` rule the
 * path matches. Unless the package sets `noparent`, the walk continues to
 * the parent package and adds its owners as **inherited**, up to the root; a
 * path whose chain declares nothing resolves to the **workspace** owners.
 *
 * A package's **upstream** is the set of packages its targets depend on,
 * transitively, through declared dependencies: what `deps()` reaches. A
 * package that declares `upstream: "review"` or `"approve"` claims changes to
 * those packages: the claiming package's own owners join the resolution as
 * suggested reviewers or required approvers, tagged `upstream-of //pkg`.
 * `packages` bounds the claim to named labels or subtree patterns.
