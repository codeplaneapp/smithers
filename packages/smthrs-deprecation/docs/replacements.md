title: "What replaced the 0.x umbrella"
description: "Every construct the smthrs facade exported in Smithers 0.x, and the 1.0 package and concept to rewrite it against. Nothing in the table is source compatible."
---

Smithers 0.x published `smthrs` as an umbrella facade over the JSX authoring
API, the React reconciler and renderer, and fourteen `@smthrs/*` packages.
Smithers 1.0 replaces that architecture with the `Flow`, `Action`, `Node`, and
Effect APIs.

Nothing below has a source-compatible replacement. Each row names the concept
to rewrite against, not a symbol to swap in.

| Removed from `smthrs`                                                       | Replacement in 1.0                                                                                                                                                              |

| The `smithers` binary published by `smthrs`                                 | [`@smthrs/cli`](/api/cli), which owns both the `smthrs` and `smithers` spellings of one executable.                                                                             |

Workflow files move with the API. `.smithers/workflows/pipelines/ci-fast.tsx`
becomes `flows/pipelines/ci-fast/flow.ts`, keeping its position, and
`smithers.config.ts` has no 1.0 equivalent.

## The mapping the tool applies is larger than this

The table above is the shape of the change. `smthrs migrate` carries the
construct-level mapping, hundreds of rows covering every export of the facade,
and records row by row in `.smithers-migrate/report.md` what it rewrote and
what it could not translate. A construct with no safe translation is left as a
`TODO(migrate-smithers-v1)` marker rather than an imitation. See
[`smthrs migrate`](/cli/migrate) and the [1.0 migration guide](/migration/1.0).

## Run state does not carry over

Smithers 1.0.0-rc.0 never loads, resumes, or migrates a 0.x run database.
Finish, archive, or discard every unfinished 0.x run with the 0.x CLI
(`bunx smthrs@0.35.0 ps`) before you upgrade; `smthrs migrate` refuses a
project whose `smithers.db` still holds runs that have not finished, and no
flag releases that refusal. The policy is frozen on the
[compatibility policy](/migration/compatibility) page.
