/**
 * Stable evaluation failure codes.
 *
 * Each code names one thing a caller can do about it, so a gate that branches
 * on the code routes the failure to the right owner:
 *
 * - `invalid_suite`: the suite declaration is wrong. Fix the suite.
 * - `invalid_run_options`: `Runner.run`'s own options are wrong, not the suite.
 * - `invalid_baseline`: the committed baseline is unreadable, belongs to
 *   another suite, or holds a record the schema rejects. Regenerate it.
 * - `invalid_tolerance`: the caller passed a tolerance that is not a finite
 *   non-negative number. Fix the call, not the baseline.
 * - `executor`: the target flow failed for a case.
 * - `ambiguous_score_job`: two score jobs shared a step key and a scorer, so
 *   an order-only batch runner's results cannot be attributed to a case. Give
 *   each case its own step key, or use a runner that implements
 *   `runBatchCorrelated`.
 * - `scorer_protocol`: a batch runner broke the `runBatch` contract by returning
 *   the wrong number of observations, or observations that identify jobs other
 *   than the ones it was given. Nothing it returned can be trusted.
 * - `scorer_unavailable`: no batch runner was available to score with.
