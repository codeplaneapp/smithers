/**
 * Webhook ingress as library code, bound to the control plane.
 *
 * Smithers 1.0 has no `listeners` verb and no gateway-level webhook
 * configuration. A webhook door is a `@smthrs/control` `Channel` an
 * application registers with `Channels`, and `Channels.ingest` runs the fixed
 * order that matters: verify the raw bytes, then decode, then map, then reach
 * `Control`. Signature verification is the amplification guard, so nothing in
 * this module lets a provider decoder run before it.
 *
 * `Channels.ingest` drops a replayed `idempotencyKey`, which is what makes a
 * provider redelivery safe to accept. The key is the caller's to supply on the
 * `RawInbound` it hands `ingest`; each provider module exports the
 * `idempotencyKey` that derives it from that provider's delivery identity, and
 * an ingress that does not pass one has no redelivery protection.
 *
 * The decoder's output is validated against `ExternalEvent` before it leaves
 * this module, so a decoder bug fails on the delivery that triggered it.
