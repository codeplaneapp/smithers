 * Message chunking at Telegram's hard `sendMessage` limit.

 * Telegram rejects a message over 4096 characters outright, so long output has
 * to be split. Splitting at the limit alone cuts words in half; this splits at
 * the last paragraph break, line break, sentence end, or word boundary that
 * fits, and cuts mid-word only when a single unbroken run is longer than the
 * limit.
 *
 * A cut never lands inside a UTF-16 surrogate pair. The limit is measured in
 * code units, because that is what Telegram counts, but a boundary that would
 * separate the halves of an astral character steps back one unit: the
 * alternative is two chunks that both render as a replacement character, which
 * is what happens to any message over the limit whose boundary falls on an
 * emoji.
