## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Added private metadata-only discovery for module, Markdown, and skill routes.
- Added bounded immutable route trees, direct command projection, an Incur CLI
  projection, and an injected `FlowInvoker` execution boundary.
- Added schema-derived argument descriptors with authoritative Effect decoding
  and encoding around every invocation.
- Added package-owned generated documentation and ESM/CJS artifact contracts.

### Changed

- Pinned `incur` to `0.4.19`, the version actually resolved by the workspace.
- Limited execution surfaces to explicitly model-invocable module routes;
  Markdown and skill routes remain metadata only.

### Security

- Added bounded snapshots for routes, commands, schemas, inputs, and outputs.
- Sanitized typed failures so raw arguments, values, and implementation causes
  do not cross the adapter boundary.
