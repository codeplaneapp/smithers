/**

 * The vitest adapter is deliberately absent from this barrel. `vitest` refuses
 * to load through `require()` and throws a message about bundlers, so a barrel
 * that re-exported it would make `require("@smthrs/testing")` fail for every
 * CommonJS consumer of the assertion helpers. Import it by its own subpath
 * instead: `import { ... } from "@smthrs/testing/Vitest"`, which is ESM-only
 * because vitest is.
