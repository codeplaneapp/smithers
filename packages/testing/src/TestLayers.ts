 * A service whose every property read is a capability violation.

 * Two earlier shapes were unsound. Returning a function for every property
 * made a synchronous data read succeed: under {@link poisoned}, `Path.sep` was
 * a function rather than `"/"`, so code that interpolated it produced garbage
 * and the purity gate reported nothing. Returning `Effect.fail` from every
 * method made the refusal *recoverable*: a plan body that wrapped a host read
 * in `Effect.catch`, `Effect.option`, `Effect.orElse`, or `Effect.result` —
 * ordinary in fallback-shaped code — swallowed the violation, the computation
 * succeeded, and `PlanAssertions.expectPure` reported the plan as pure.
 *
 * A thrown `CapabilityContractError` is neither: it fires on a data read as
 * loudly as on a method call, and it cannot be caught by `Effect.catch` or
 * `Effect.catchTag`, which is the semantics "a plan must never touch this"
 * requires.
 * The read raises synchronously, so it becomes a defect wherever Effect
 * captures the throw and a thrown error where it does not. `expectPure`
 * catches the whole cause, so a violation inside a plan computation still
 * surfaces as a typed `purity_violation`.
