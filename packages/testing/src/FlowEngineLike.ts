/**
 * `EngineSubject` adapter over the real `/engine`.
 *
 * This is the authoritative subject for the core conformance operations in
 * `docs/specs/Research/Smithers Testing Library Conversion 2026-07-27.md`:
 * identity, replay, race, and interruption run against the production engine,
 * not a test-only model. Smithers capabilities absent from the production
 * contract are recorded as parity gaps rather than simulated. The adapter
 * registers each `FlowSpec` as a real `Flow` whose execute function
 * runs every step as an `Action`:
 *
 * - Sealed steps declare their spec key as the activity idempotency key, so
 *   the engine derives content identity from it and aliased sealed steps
 *   replay one recorded result.
 * - Unsealed steps declare no idempotency key, so the engine derives
 *   occurrence (ordinal) identity and duplicate declared keys run separately.
 * - Race steps run through `Action.raceAll`, the engine's durable race.
 *
 * Step outcomes are journaled by the adapter as they settle; replayed steps
 * never invoke their closures, so the journal is written exactly once per
 * behavior-bearing outcome.
