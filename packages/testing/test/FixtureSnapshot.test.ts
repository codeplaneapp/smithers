/**
 * A recorder writes what the provider saw, and a fixture keeps it.
 *
 * Both halves used to alias caller-owned collections across the asynchronous
 * boundary: the request was projected after the whole stream had run, emitted
 * events were pushed by reference, and `parameters`, `stopSequences`, and
 * `itemIds` were carried through untouched. With a file-backed store the
 * recorded object is re-encoded on every later append, so a harness that
 * reused one tool array across turns and rewrote its schema retroactively
 * rewrote entries it had already recorded.
