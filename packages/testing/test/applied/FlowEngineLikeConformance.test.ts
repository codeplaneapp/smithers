/**
 * Engine conformance, applied to the volatile runtime.
 *
 * What this certifies: the identity, replay, race, and interruption pins run
 * against `FlowEngine.layerMemory`, the in-memory implementation of the
 * production `FlowRuntime` port that ships in `@smthrs/engine`. The subject is
 * the real adapter in `src/FlowEngineLike.ts`, which drives that runtime
 * through its public `register`/`execute`/`poll`/`resume` surface, so these
 * are the engine's own semantics rather than a hand-written stand-in.
 *
 * What it does NOT certify: durability. `layerMemory` keeps every execution,
 * action, and journal entry in process memory, so nothing here survives a
 * restart, and the durable driver in `@smthrs/engine-store` (leases, the SQLite
 * journal, attempt and cache stores, snapshot boundaries) never runs. "Replay"
 * below means the runtime replaying a recorded result inside one process.
 *
 * Connecting the durable engine is a layer swap, not a rewrite: the binding
 * below takes any `Layer<FlowRuntime>`, and the durable one is
 * `EngineStore.layer({ owner, journalSource })`, which needs `AttemptStore`,
 * `CacheStore`, `Crypto`, `DurableEngineState`, `Journal`, `Jj`,
 * `OwnerIdentity`, `RunStore`, `Scope`, and `StepBoundary`. All of that lives
 * in `@smthrs/engine-store`, which `@smthrs/testing` does not depend on and
 * must not, so the durable application belongs in a suite that already has
 * that dependency.
 *
 * Source parity:
 * `docs/specs/Research/Smithers Test Parity 2026-07-28.md` and
 * `docs/reference/test-parity.md`.
