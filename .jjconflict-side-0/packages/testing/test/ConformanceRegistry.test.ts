/**
 * The mandatory pin registry must survive a consumer that writes to what it
 * hands back.
 *
 * `coreSuite()` used to return the registry's own array, so a consumer could
 * splice a mandatory pin out and every later call in the process returned the
 * shortened list. Freezing the array alone left the same hole one level down:
 * the case records were shared mutable objects, so assigning to a returned
 * case's `name` or `run` replaced a mandatory pin's assertion for every later
 * caller.
