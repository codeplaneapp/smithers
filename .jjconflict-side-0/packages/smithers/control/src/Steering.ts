/**
 * The steer lifecycle as the control plane reads it back.
 *
 * A steer has two durable moments and two different writers. The control plane
 * records the first — `control.steer.enqueued`, written beside the admission
 * it caused. The second belongs to `@smthrs/notifications`: a turn boundary
 * promotes the notification and the queue journals the promotion. This module
 * projects that promotion into the control vocabulary, so a watcher folds one
 * stream instead of two, and so nothing writes "delivered" twice.
 *
 * Deriving rather than re-recording is what keeps the two halves honest. A
 * control plane that emitted its own delivery record would be asserting a fact
 * it did not observe: the boundary that delivered the steer runs in the agent
 * process, not this one.
 *
