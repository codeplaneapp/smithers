/**
 * The boundary fold refuses evidence that does not describe one crossing.
 *
 * `EffectStatus` is monotonic: `intended`, then at most one terminal record.
 * The fold used to keep whichever record the caller listed last, so a
 * conflicted or reordered journal turned an `unknown` outcome, which must
 * block a rewind, into a `succeeded` one a handler would compensate before
 * its evidence was truncated. These cases pin the legal histories, every
 * conflict, and the golden vector `guard` itself produces.
