/**
 * The offline reviewer the seeded-bug suite gates on.
 *
 * A live model is not reproducible and costs money, so the committed baseline
 * cannot be a model's score. This is what it measures instead: a small,
 * deterministic reviewer that reads the same per-file prompt a real seat reads
 * and reports findings from a handful of textual signals in the added lines.
 *
 * What a green gate therefore proves is the PIPELINE, not the model — diff
 * ingestion, per-file fan-out, scoping, anchoring, de-duplication, and the
 * scorer's matching — because that is the half of the eval a code change can
 * break. The model's own score is what `--live` measures, and its numbers
 * belong in `SCORECARD.md`, not in a gate.
 *
 * The reviewer never reads `label.json`. A reviewer that did would score
 * perfectly and measure nothing.
