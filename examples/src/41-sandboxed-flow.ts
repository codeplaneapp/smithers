/**
 * Run a child flow's code inside a provisioned environment as one parent action.
 *
 * `SandboxedFlow` bundles the child module and guest runner, starts Node inside
 * the session, and validates the guest's result against the child schema. The
 * parent records this as one durable action.
 *
 * A second drive over the same SQLite state reuses the recorded result without
 * acquiring another session. `collectDiff` returns the guest-written file as
 * data; applying that change elsewhere remains the caller's decision.
