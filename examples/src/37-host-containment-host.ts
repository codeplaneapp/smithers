/**
 * The host program `37-host-containment.ts` kills.

 * from inside the process that has to observe it.
 *
 * Usage: `node 37-host-containment-host.ts <sqlite file> <hostId>`. It prints
 * the process id of the group it started, then waits to be killed. Startup
 * failures print their cause to stderr and exit with status 1.
